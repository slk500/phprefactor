#+Title: PHPRefactor

* Refactorings
** Add Type-Hint
*** If you CAN type-hint, then you MUST type-hint
Smell: A method with no type defined parameters or return type declaration
#+BEGIN_SRC php
public function setNumber($number)
{
    $this->number = $number;
}
#+END_SRC
**** Refactor the code
#+BEGIN_SRC php
public function setNumber(int $number): void
{
    $this->number = $number;
}
#+END_SRC
**** Helper 
[[https://github.com/dunglas/phpdoc-to-typehint][phpdoc-to-typehint]] adds automatically scalar type hints and return types to all functions and methods using existing PHPDoc annotations 
**** Further Reading 
https://thecodingmachine.io/type-hint-all-the-things
/** @return Collection|Order[] */

*** If you are type-hinting an array, you MUST document the array type in a docblock
Smell: An array with elements of generic type or method which can throw Exception
#+BEGIN_SRC php
public function printUsersNames(array $users): void
{
    foreach ($users as $user) {
        echo $user->getName();
    }
}
#+END_SRC
**** Refactor the code
Add PHPDoc - the Object[] notation in addition to an array type-hint to explain what kind of object is expected
#+BEGIN_SRC php
/**
 ,* @param User[] $users
 ,*/
public function printUsersNames(array $users): void
{
    foreach ($users as $user) {
        echo $user->getName();
    }
}
#+END_SRC
** Consolidate Conditional Expression
     Smell: Sequence of conditionals with the same result
#+BEGIN_SRC php
class Sale
{
    public function calculateShipping(Customer $customer)
    {
        if ($customer->isEmployee) return 0;
        if ($customer->isGoldCustomer) return 0;
        if ($customer->isHasACoupon) return 0;
        
        if($isUsa) return 10;
        if($isEurope) return 20;
    }
}
#+END_SRC
*** Write a test that pass
*** Refactor the code 
      Combine them into a single conditional expression and extract it.
#+BEGIN_SRC php
class Sale
{
    public function calculateShipping(Customer $customer): int
    {
       if ($this->isFreeShipping()){
           return 0;

        if($isUsa) {
            return 10;

** Consolidate Duplicate Conditional Fragments
     Smell: The same fragment of code is in all branches of a conditional expression.
#+BEGIN_SRC php

    public function calculateTotal(int $price)
    {
        if ($this->isSpecialDeal()) {

            $this->setTotal($total);
        }
        else {
            $total = $price * 0.98;
            $this->setTotal($total);
        }
    }
}
#+END_SRC
*** Write a test that pass
*** Refactor the code 
      Move it outside of the expression.
#+BEGIN_SRC php

     Smell: Complicated conditional (if-else) statement.
#+BEGIN_SRC php

    public $expired_at;
    public $amount;

    public function getAmount()
    {
        if(null !== $this->expired_at && $this->expired_at < time())

        }
        else
        {
            $discount = 10;
            $this->amount = $this->amount - ($this->amount / 100 * $discount);
        }
        return $this->amount;
    }

#+END_SRC
*** Write a test that pass

        $sale->expired_at = strtotime('-10 days');
        $this->assertEquals(10 + (10 / 100 * 10), $sale->getAmount());
        $sale = new Sale();

        $sale->amount = 10;
        $sale->expired_at = strtotime('+10 days');
        $this->assertEquals(10 - (10 / 100 * 10), $sale->getAmount());
    }
}
#+END_SRC
*** Refactor the code
Extract conditional code in a private method. We name the method isExpired() because our conditional chunk of code checks if the sale is expired. We create the private method isExpired() and, with the technique of extract method, we move chunks of code into the new method. The next step is to move each branch of the condition in a private method. We do the same as we did before for each branch. So we create the private method getAmountWithInterest() for the first branch and the method getAmountWithDiscount() for the second branch.
#+BEGIN_SRC php
class Sale
{
    public $expired_at;
    public $amount;

    public function getAmount()
    {
        if ($this->isExpired()) {
            return $this->getAmountWithInterest();
        } else {
            return $this->getAmountWithDiscount();
        }
    }

    private function isExpired()
    {
        return !is_null($this->expired_at) && $this->expired_at < time();
    }

    private function getAmountWithInterest()
    {
        $interest = 10;
        return $this->amount + ($this->amount / 100 * $interest);
    }

    private function getAmountWithDiscount()
    {

*** Info
    The best practice is that if you pass parameters into a method then they should always represent what were passed in and never be reassigned to mean something else. Btw. in Java you can prevent variable’s reassignment by keyword 'final' before a parameter https://stackoverflow.com/questions/500508/why-should-i-use-the-keyword-final-on-a-method-parameter-in-java

#+END_SRC
*** Pass a test
*** Info 
    Now, but wait, you might say. Isn't this more inefficient? Because if we created the temp the old way, we'd only have to execute the expression once, but if we turn it into a method, we might be calling it many different times. And yes, you're absolutely right, but remember, the pure efficiency of the code is not our first goal in refactoring. Clarity is. The likelihood is that a typical expression you would deal with in this sort of refactoring is going to be so undemanding, it wouldn't be noticeable at all, even having to call it several more times. But if it is an intensive operation, an intensive expression, well you should really be working on that later, after you've refactored using profilers. And other tools to make sure you're not doing pointless, premature optimization. And the real benefit is that by creating this as its own method, we will also have use of it anywhere else in the class, which wasn't the case before. As the original temp was scoped to the original method. So, we won't be tempted to add more code to the original method just to have access to that temp.

- Automated testing follows the same steps as manual testing, but it's much quicker. While there is an initial time investment to write the scripts, once the scripts are complete they can be run repeatedly without much additional cost.
- There will be maintenance that is required, but it saves time in the long run. This makes automation have a great return on investment. In addition, the exact same steps are executed every time, which reduces any possibility of human error.

"The hardest part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build." - Fred Brooks


If you're having trouble, example mapping helps us keep these conversations short and on track by creating a visual representation of a user story to guide and document the discussion. The process of example mapping is fairly straightforward. Using a four-color pack of index cards, we build a visual representation of our user's story with each color providing a specific piece of information. We build this as we have our conversation to document what is discovered through the discussion about the user's story.

We begin with a yellow card, which contains the name of our story itself and place this at the very top. Our blue cards represent specific rules that constrain the scope of our story. This is our acceptance criteria. With green cards, we provide concrete examples of the user's story in the context of a specific rule. So we place these under the relevant blue card. And finally, we have our red cards. These cards contain questions that cannot be immediately answered during the discussion, but are captured so that we can move on with the conversation.

***** Acceptance criteria
****** addresses what defines a working system
****** written as pass/fail
***** Scenario 
****** defines the initial conditions for acceptance criteria
****** states the trigger of scenario and expected outcome 

**** Gherkin Syntax 
***** Feature: feature story - name of the feature and possibly brief description
****** Scenario: a user story - single concrete example of how a system should behave - each feature generally have 5-20 scenarios - Scenarios describe the behaviour of the system under specific initial conditions.
****** Given: some set of initial conditions - describe the context or precondition for the scenario
****** When: an event occurs - identifies an event or actor enacted by some actor on the system
****** Then: an outcome is expected - provides the expected outcome to the scenario

**** Example
***** Feature : Customer pays with a credit card    
****** As a sales associate 
****** I should be able to process payments
****** when given a credit card

Now we're ready to translate our conversation into scenarios that describe the concrete behavior of the application. Ideally, this is done using declared dephrasing, meaning without referencing the particulars of a user interface or sequence of steps. Remember that Gherkin is a way to phrase our acceptance criteria as an executable scenario that describes the behavior of a system. So, our conversations would describe the behavior of the system under specific initial conditions.

****** Scenario 1
******* Total charge is over the $2 credit card minimum. 
******* Given: Maria orders $3 of coffee from Li. 
******* When: Maria pays with a credit card. 
******* Then:  Lit should process the payment. 

****** Scenario 2
******* Total charge is under the $2 credit card minimum.
******* Given: Maria orders $1 of coffee from Li.
******* When: Maria pays with a credit card.
******* Then: Li should not process the payment.
**** Test Automation
Allows for the execution of software tests that compare the expectations for software with the actual outcomes. Testing can be repetitive process and automation can be a boon to productivity.
  
**** Living Documentation
Is a system for dynamically generating documentation that contains information which is up to date and accurate.
Cucumber provides a system that dynamically generates documentation because of the manner that tests are written. Because Cucumber tests are written in a way that can be easily interpreted by non-technical stakeholders and, at the same time, be executed by a computer, your tests themselves become a living source of documentation that reflect the accuracy of your application. Cucumber was designed to enhance the practice of test-driven development. It provides a single source of truth for an application's lifecycle by merging test automation and test documentation.

**** Notes
***** BDD is a process, not a tool
***** Specialized frameworks can assist in this process by providing a common language for acceptance criteria.

To types of BDD:
1. Story - is done with Behat & functional tests
2. Spec  - is done with PHPSpec & Unit tests

4 Steps to BDD
1.Define Business Value of all big features
2.Prioritize you features
3.Break feature down into user stories
4.Write the code for the feature

**** Working Effectively with Legacy Code; 2005
 - To me, legacy code is simply code without tests. I’ve gotten some grief for this definition. What do tests have to do with whether code is bad? To me, the answer is straightforward, and it is a point that I elaborate throughout the book: 'Code without tests is bad code. It doesn’t matter how well written it is; it doesn’t matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don’t know if our code is getting better or worse.'

 - being able to confidently make changes in any code base.

 - Preserving existing behavior

 - Changes in a system can be made in two primary ways. I like to call them Edit and Pray and Cover and Modify. Unfortunately, Edit and Pray is pretty much the industry standard. When you use Edit and Pray, you carefully plan the changes you are going to make, you make sure that you understand the code you are going to modify, and then you start to make the changes. When you’re done, you run the system to see if the change was enabled, and then you poke around further to make sure that you didn’t break anything. The poking around is essential. When you make your changes, you are hoping and praying that you’ll get them right, and you take extra time when you are done to make sure that you did.

 - ...testing is a tough problem, and people are often seduced by the idea that they can test through a GUI or web interface without having to do anything special to their application. It can be done, but it is usually more work than anyone on a team is prepared to admit. In addition, a user interface often isn’t the best place to write tests. UIs are often volatile and too far from the functionality being tested. When UI-based tests fail, it can be hard to figure out why. Regardless, people  often spend considerable money trying to do all of their testing with those sorts of tools.
   
 - Pay now or pay more later

As a program is evolved its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it.
Lehman’s law of Increasing Complexity [1]

Borrowing a phrase from the health care domain “a good doctor is one who knows the medicines but a great doctor is one who knows the disease”

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Booch#cite_note-16][Grady Booch]]

We believe that the impact of a smell can only be judged based on the design context in which it occurs.

However, today, software engineers are expected to build really complex software within a short time frame in an environment where requirements are continuously changing. Needless to say, it is a huge challenge to maintain the quality of the design and overall software in such a context.

In the midst of this struggle, it became clear to us that if we wanted to organize this collection so that we could share it in a beneficial manner with fellow architects, designers, and developers, our classification scheme should be linked to something fundamental, i.e., design principles.

**** design smells?
Design smells are certain structures in the design that indicate violation of fundamental design principles and negatively impact design quality.
In other words, a design smell indicates a potential problem in the design structure. The medical domain provides a good analogy for our work on smells. The symptoms of a patient can be likened to a “smell,” and the underlying disease can be likened to the concrete “design problem.”
**** technical debt
Technical debt is the debt that accrues when you knowingly or unknowingly make wrong or non-optimal design decisions.  Technical debt is a metaphor coined by Ward Cunningham in a 1992 report [44]. Technical debt is analogous to financial debt. When a person takes a loan (or uses his credit card), he incurs debt. If he regularly pays the installments (or the credit card bill) then the created debt is repaid and does not create further problems.  However, if the person does not pay his installment (or bill), a penalty in the form of interest is applicable and it mounts every time he misses the payment. In case the person is not able to pay the installments (or bill) for a long time, the accrued interest can make the total debt so ominously large that the person may have to declare bankruptcy.

•	Code debt: Static analysis tool violations and inconsistent coding style.
•	Design debt: Design smells and violations of design rules.
•	Test debt: Lack of tests, inadequate test coverage, and improper test design.
•	Documentation debt: No documentation for important concerns, poor docu-
mentation, and outdated documentation.

Jim Highsmith [45] describes how Cost of Change (CoC) varies wth technical debt.

**** PHAME
We treat the four major elements of Booch’s object model as “design principles” and refer to them collectively as PHAME (Principles of Hierarchy, Abstraction, Modularization, and Encapsulation).
**** Booch’s fundamental design principles
***** abstraction
The principle of abstraction advocates the simplification of entities through reduction and generalization: reduction is by elimination of unnecessary details and generalization is by identification and specification of common and important characteristics.

****** Missing Abstraction
Clumps of data or encoded strings are used instead of creating a class or an interface

******* Rationale
- It can expose implementation details to different abstractions, violating the principle of encapsulation.
- When data and associated behavior are spread across abstractions, it can lead to tight coupling between entities, resulting in brittle and non-reusable code. Hence, not creating necessary abstractions also violates the principle of modularization.
******* Potential Causes
******** Inadequate design analysis
When careful thought is not applied during design, it is easy to overlook creating abstractions and use primitive type values or strings to “get the work done.” In our experience, this often occurs when software is developed under tight deadlines or resource constraints.
******** Lack of refactoring
As requirements change, software evolves and entities that were earlier represented using strings or primitive types may need to be refactored into classes or interfaces.  When the existing clumps of data or encoded strings are retained as they are without refactoring them, it can lead to a Missing Abstraction smell.
******** Misguided focus on minor performance gains 
This smell often results when designers compromise design quality for minor performance gains. For instance, we have observed developers using arrays directly in the code instead of creating appropriate abstractions since they feel that indexing arrays is faster than accessing members in objects. In most contexts, the performance gains due to such “optimizations” are minimal, and do not justify the resultant trade-off in design quality.

******* Examples
******** from, to
data clumps always used together
******* Refactor
create abstraction(s) that can internally make use
of primitive type values or strings.
******* Alias
******** Primitive Obsession
This smell occurs when [[*primitive elements - types][primitive types]] are used for encoding dates, currency, etc. instead of creating classes.
******** Data clumps
This smell occurs when there are clumps of data items that occur together in lots of places instead of creating a class.
****** Imperative Abstraction
This smell arises when an operation is turned into a class. This smell manifests as a class that has only one method defined within the class. At times, the class name itself may be identical to the one method defined within it. For instance, if you see class with name Read that contains only one method named read() with no data members, then the Read class has Imperative Abstraction smell. Often, it is also seen in the case of this smell that the data on which the method operates is located within a different class.  It should be noted that it is sometimes desirable to turn an operation into a class.
******* Rationale
Defining functions or procedures explicitly as classes (when the data is located somewhere else) is a glorified form of structured programing rather than object-oriented programming. One-operation classes cannot be representative of an “abstraction,” especially when the associated data is placed somewhere else. Clearly, this is a violation of the principle of abstraction. Since these classes are ‘doing’ things instead of ‘being’ things, this smell is named Imperative Abstraction.  If operations are turned into classes, the design will suffer from an explosion of one-method classes and increase the complexity of the design. Furthermore, many of these methods that act on the same data would be separated into different classes and thus reduce the cohesiveness of the design. For these reasons, this smell also violates the principles of encapsulation and modularization.
The smell not only increases the number of classes (in this case there are at least four classes when ideally one could have been used), but also increases the complex- ity involved in development and maintenance because of the unnecessary separation of cohesive methods.
******* Potential Causes
******** procedural thinking
******* Refactor
To refactor the Imperative Abstraction design smell, you have to either find or create an appropriate abstraction to house the method existing within the Imperative Abstraction. You also have to encapsulate the data needed by the method within the same abstraction to improve cohesion and reduce coupling.
******* Reification 
is the promotion or elevation of something that is not an object into an object. When we reify behavior, it is possible to store it, pass it, or transform it. Reification improves flexibility of the system at the cost of introducing some complexity [52].  Many design patterns [54] employ reification. Examples:

• State pattern: Encoding a state-machine.

• Command pattern: Encoding requests as command objects. A permitted exception for this smell is when a Command pattern has been used to objectify method requests.

• Strategy pattern: Parameterizing a procedure in terms of an operation it uses.

In other words, when we consciously design in such a way to elevate non-objects to objects for better reusability, flexibility, and extensibility (i.e., for improving
design quality), it is not a smell.

******* Aliases
“Operation class” ??? [51,52] — This smell occurs when an operation that should have been a method within a class has been turned into a class itself.
****** Incomplete Abstraction
An abstraction (entity or interface) does not support complementary or interrelated methods completely
For example, if we need to be able to add or remove elements in a data
structure, the type abstracting that data structure should support both add() and
remove() methods. Supporting only one of them makes the abstraction incomplete

| Min/max        | Open/close  | Create/destroy | Get/set   |
| Read/write     | Print/scan  | First/last     | Begin/end |
| Start/stop     | Lock/unlock | Show/hide      | Up/down   |
| First/last     | Push/pull   |                |           |
| Enable/disable | Left/right  | On/off         |           |

Sometimes, a designer may make a conscious design decision to not provide symmetric or matching methods. For example, in a read-only collection, only add() method may be provided without the corresponding remove() method. In such a case, the abstraction may appear incomplete, but is not a smell.

******* Aliases
This smell is also known in literature as:
  
• “Class supports incomplete behavior” [18]—This smell occurs when the public interface of a class is incomplete and does not support all the behavior needed by objects of that class.

• “Half-hearted operations” [63]—This smell occurs when interrelated methods provided in an incomplete or in an inconsistent way; this smell could lead to runtime problems.
****** Multifaceted Abstraction
This smell arises when an abstraction has more than one responsibility assigned to it.

In particular, the Single Responsibility Principle says that an abstraction should have a single well-defined responsibility and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated
within that abstraction. 

Since the abstraction has multiple “faces” or “responsibilities”, it is named Multifaceted Abstraction.

Single “Responsibility” Principle) does not mean logical grouping of all functionality related to a concept. Rather “responsibility” refers to a concrete, specific, and precise responsibility that has one reason to change

******* Potential Causes
******** General-purpose abstractions
An abstraction with a generic name (Node , Component, Element, and Item ), it often becomes a “placeholder” for providing all the functionality related (but not necessarily belonging) to that abstraction. Hence, general purpose abstractions often exhibit this smell.
******** Evolution without periodic refactoring
When a class undergoes extensive changes over a long period of time without refac- toring, other responsibilities start getting introduced in these classes and design decay starts. In this way, negligence toward refactoring leads to the creation of monolithic blobs that exhibit multiple responsibilities.
******** The burden of processes
Sometimes the viscosity of the software and environment serves to discourage the adoption of good practices.
******** Mixing up concerns
******* Example
Classes exhibiting Multifaceted Abstraction are usually large and complex.  For example, java.util.Calendar class (in JDK 7) spans 2825 lines of code and has 67 methods and 71 fields! However, large or complex implementation is not an essential characteristic of classes having Multifaceted Abstraction smell; see the discussion on Insufficient Modularization smell (Section 5.2).

******* Aliases
• “Divergent change” [7]—This smell occurs when a class is changed for different reasons.

• “Conceptualization abuse” [30]—This smell occurs when two or more noncohesive concepts have been packed into a single class of the system.
	 
• “Large class” [7,24,57,58]—This smell occurs when a class has “too many” responsibilities.
	 
• “Lack of cohesion” [59]—This smell occurs when there is a large type in a design with low cohesion, i.e., a “kitchen sink” type that represents many abstractions.

****** Unnecessary Abstraction
An abstraction that is not needed

ALIASES:
Irrelevant class - class does not have any meaningful behavior in the design
Lazy class / Freeloader — class does “too little”
Small class - class has no (or too few) variables or no (or too few) methods in it
Mini-class - a public, non-nested class defines less than three methods and less than three attributes (including constants) in it
No responsibility - class has no responsibility associated with it
Agent classes - class serve as an “agent” (i.e., they only pass messages from one class to another), indicating that the class may be unnecessary
****** Unutilized Abstraction
An abstraction is left unused (either not directly used or not
reachable). This smell manifests in two forms:

• Unreferenced abstractions—Concrete classes that are not being used by anyone
• Orphan abstractions—Stand-alone interfaces/abstract classes that do not have
any derived abstractions


This smell violates the principle YAGNI (You
Aren’t Gonna Need It), which recommends not adding functionality until deemed
necessary [53]

When an abstraction is left unused
in design, it does not serve a meaningful purpose in design, and hence violates the
principle of abstraction.

POTENTIAL CAUSES:
Leftover garbage during maintenance or refactoring.
Speculative generality - abstractions are introduced speculating that they may be required sometime in future.


REFACTORING:
remove the Unutilized Abstraction from the design.

IMPACT:
pollutes the design space and increases cognitive load. This impacts understandability.
UNUTILIZED ABSTRACTION
Two or more abstractions have identical names or identical implementation or both


POTENTIAL CAUSES:

Copy-paste programming
The “get-the-work-done” mindset of a programmer leads him to copy and paste code
instead of applying proper abstraction.
Ad hoc maintenance
When the software undergoes haphazard fixes or enhancements over many years, it
leaves “crufts”6 with lots of redundant code in it.
Lack of communication
Often, in industrial software, code duplication occurs because different people work
on the same code at different times in the life cycle of the software. They are not
aware of existing classes or methods and end up re-inventing the wheel.

REFACTORING:
For identical name form, the suggested refactoring is to rename one of the abstrac-
tions to a unique name.
In the case of the identical implementation form of Duplicate Abstraction, if the
implementations are exactly the same, one of the implementations can be removed.
If the implementations are slightly different, then the common implementation in
the duplicate abstractions can be factored out into a common class.


IMPACT:
it affects understandability of the design. Developers of client code will be confused and unclear about the choice
of the abstraction that should be used by their code.

identical implementation (i.e., they have duplicate code), it becomes difficult to maintain them.
In summary, this smell indicates a violation of the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
principle.
If the DRY principle is not fol-
lowed, a modification of an element within the system requires modifications to other
logically unrelated elements making maintainability a nightmare. Since there is dupli-
cation among abstractions in the design, this smell is named Duplicate Abstraction.

3.7.6 ALIASES
This smell is also known in literature as:

•	“Alternative classes with different interfaces” [7]—This smell occurs when
classes do similar things, but have different names.
•	“Duplicate design artifacts” [74]—This smell occurs when equivalent design
artifacts are replicated throughout the architecture.

**** Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code; 2018
- With any introductory example, however, I run into a problem. If I pick a large program, describing it and how it is refactored is too complicated for a mortal reader to work through.(...) However, if I pick a program that is small enough to be comprehensible, refactoring does not look like it is worthwhile.
 
- Thus, if I’m faced with modifying a program with hundreds of lines of code, I’d rather it be structured into a set of functions and other program elements that allow me to understand more easily what the program is doing. If the program lacks structure, it’s usually easier for me to add structure to the program first, and then make the change I need.

- If the code works and doesn’t ever need to change, it’s perfectly fine to leave it alone. It would be nice to improve it, but unless someone needs to understand it, it isn’t causing any real harm. Yet as soon as someone does need to understand how that code works, and struggles to follow it, then you have to do something about it.

- Refactoring changes the programs in small steps, so if you make a mistake, it is easy to find where the bug is.

- Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.

- The true test of good code is how easy it is to change it.

- Refactoring (noun): a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.
- Refactoring (verb): to restructure software by applying a series of refactorings without changing its observable behavior.

- Refactoring is very similar to performance optimization, as both involve carrying out code manipulations that don’t change the overall functionality of the program. The difference is the purpose: Refactoring is always done to make the code “easier to understand and cheaper to modify.” This might speed things up or slow things down. With performance optimization, I only care about speeding up the program, and am prepared to end up with code that is harder to work with if I really need that improved performance.

- Without refactoring, the internal design—the architecture—of software tends to decay.As people change code to achieve short­term goals, often without a full comprehensionof the architecture, the code loses its structure. It becomes harder for me to see thedesign by reading the code. Loss of the structure of code has a cumulative effect. Theharder it is to see the design in the code, the harder it is for me to preserve it, and themore rapidly it decays. Regular refactoring helps keep the code in shape.

- It reminds me of a statement Kent Beck often makes about himself: “I’m not a great programmer; I’m just a good programmer with great habits.” Refactoring helps me be much more effective at writing robust code. 

- Branches. As I write this, a common approach in teams is for each team member to work on abranch of the code base using a version control system, and do considerable work onthat branch before integrating with a mainline (often called master or trunk) sharedacross the team. Often, this involves building a whole feature on a branch, notintegrating into the mainline until the feature is ready to be released into production.Fans of this approach claim that it keeps the mainline clear of any in­process code,provides a clear version history of feature additions, and allows features to be revertedeasily should they cause problems.There are downsides to feature branches like this. The longer I work on an isolatedbranch, the harder the job of integrating my work with mainline is going to be when I’mdone. Most people reduce this pain by frequently merging or re­basing from mainlineto my branch. But this doesn’t really solve the problem when several people areworking on individual feature branches. I distinguish between merging and integration.If I merge mainline into my code, this is a oneway movement—my branch changes butthe mainline doesn’t. I use “integrate” to mean a two­way process that pulls changesfrom mainline into my branch and then pushes the result back into mainline, changingboth. If Rachel is working on her branch I don’t see her changes until she integrateswith mainline; at that point, I have to merge her changes into my feature branch, whichmay mean considerable work. The hard part of this work is dealing with semanticchanges. Modern version control systems can do wonders with merging complexchanges to the program text, but they are blind to the semantics of the code. If I’vechanged the name of a function, my version control tool may easily integrate mychanges with Rachel’s. But if, in her branch, she added a call to a function that I’verenamed in mine, the code will fail.The problem of complicated merges gets exponentially worse as the length of featurebranches increases. Integrating branches that are four weeks old is more than twice ashard as those that are a couple of weeks old. Many people, therefore, argue for keepingfeature branches short—perhaps just a couple of days. Others, such as me, want themeven shorter than that. This is an approach called Continuous Integration (CI), alsoknown as Trunk­Based Development. With CI, each team member integrates withmainline at least once per day. This prevents any branches diverting too far from eachother and thus greatly reduces the complexity of merges. CI doesn’t come for free: Itmeans you use practices to ensure the mainline is healthy, learn to break large featuresinto smaller chunks, and use feature toggles (aka feature flags) to switch off any in­process features that can’t be broken down.Fans of CI like it partly because it reduces the complexity of merges, but the dominantreason to favor CI is that it’s far more compatible with refactoring. Refactorings ofteninvolve making lots of little changes all over the code base—which are particularlyprone to semantic merge conflicts (such as renaming a widely used function). Many ofus have seen feature­branching teams that find refactorings so exacerbate mergeproblems that they stop refactoring. CI and re­factoring work well together, which iswhy Kent Beck combined them in Extreme Programming.I’m not saying that you should never use feature branches. If they are sufficiently short,their problems are much reduced. (Indeed, users of CI usually also use branches, butintegrate them with mainline each day.) Feature branches may be the right techniquefor open source projects where you have infrequent commits from programmers whoyou don’t know well (and thus don’t trust). But in a full­time development team, thecost that feature branches impose on refactoring is excessive. Even if you don’t go to fullCI, I certainly urge you to integrate as frequently as possible. You should also considerthe objective evidence [Forsgren et al.] that teams that use CI are more effective insoftware delivery.

- There are two parts to learning craftsmanship: knowledge and work. You must gain the knowledge of principles, patterns, practices, and heuristics that a craftsman knows, and you must also grind that knowledge into your fingers, eyes, and gut by working hard and practicing.
- Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless it’s actually a List. The word list means something specific to programmers. If the container holding the accounts is not actually a List, it may lead to false conclusions (even if the container is a List, it’s probably better not to encode the container type into the name). So accountGroup or bunchOfAccounts or just plain accounts would be better.
- A truly awful example of disinformative names would be the use of lower-case L or uppercase O as variable names, especially in combination. The problem, of course, is that they look almost entirely like the constants one and zero, respectively.
- Certainly a loop counter may be named i or j or k (though never l!) if its scope is very small and no other names can conflict with it. This is because those single-letter names for loop counters are traditional.

- In order to be able to improve software maintainability, its current state and possible improvement efforts must be made measurable. However, assessing maintainability is a difficult task. Widely studied object-oriented metrics (Briand et al., 1997, 1999; Chidamber and Kemerer, 1994; Harrison et al., 1998; Henderson-Sellers, 1996; Hitz and Montazeri, 1996; Lorenz and Kidd, 1994) offer a way to assess software maintainability. Although some studies report successes in measuring maintainability with metrics (Bansiya and David, 2002; Chidamber et al., 1998; Coleman et al., 1994; Li and Henry 1993; Subramanyam and Krishnan, 2003), there are people, especially in the agile community (Beck et al., 2001), who are critical to using metrics for maintainability assessment, since they feel that metrics fail to account for the breadth of issues that humans consider when evaluating code.
- Yet, software quality, as quality in general, is largely dependent on one’s point of view (Garvin 1984; Kitchenham and Pfleeger, 1996). From a developer’s viewpoint the ease of modifying and further developing the software is clearly one of the most important quality dimensions. Traditionally one would call this viewpoint to quality software maintainability.
- Cusumano and Selby (Cusumano and Selby, 1995) describe how Microsoft uses 20% of its development effort to re-develop the code base of its products. Cusumano and Yoffie (Cusumano and Yoffie, 1998) report how Netscape’s inability to refactor the code base hindered their software development, and how Microsoft’s redesign efforts in the Internet Explorer 3.0 project later paid off.
- The agile community...has come up with a term called code smell (Fowler and Beck, 2000) to help software developers recognise problematic code. These code smells are general descriptions of bad code that are supposed to help software developers decide when the code needs refactoring. In most cases, the goal of code refactoring is to make the software easier to understand and/or extend. Fowler and Beck (Fowler and Beck, 2000) claim that exact criteria cannot be given to determine when a software needs refactoring. In their words, when it comes to making refactoring decisions: "no set of metrics rivals informed human intuition." This opinion is in conflict with the idea that the level of software maintainability can be determined with source code or design metrics. A counterexample to Fowler and Beck is provided by Grady (Grady, 1994), who reports that in some HP divisions there were tight threshold limits that a program was not allowed to exceed, e.g., a Fortran program’s cyclomatic complexity (McCabe, 1976) should not exceed 15.  This threshold was determined based on data from previous software projects.  Also, the idea of measuring software maintainability with metrics (Coleman et al., 1994, 1995) seems to be conflicting with the idea of assessing maintainability using vaguely defined qualitative criteria, such as the code smells of Fowler and Beck.
- Traditionally, the term software maintainability has been used to represent this quality attribute, and IEEE (IEEE, 1990) has defined software maintainability as follows: the ease with which a software system or component can be modified to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt to a changed environment.
- We think that the term software evolution better describes what happens after the initial software deployment/release...
- Fowler and Beck (2000) propose a list of 22 bad code smells. Fowler and Beck introduce code smells as a more concrete indication of the need for refactoring than "some vague idea of programming aesthetics." They also claim that no set of precise metrics can be given to identify the need for refactoring. Thus, the code smells can be seen as a compromise between precise source code metrics and totally unguided subjective evaluation. In their experience, Fowler and Beck say that when it comes to making refactoring decisions, no set of metrics rivals informed human intuition. The code smells have been developed based on Fowler’s and Beck’s industrial experience in several software projects that according to them varied from successful to nearly catastrophic. Some code smells represent two extremes of the same attribute. For example, the size of a class could be an attribute. Too much of it leads to a smell called 'Large Class’’ and too little to the 'Lazy Class’’ smell. The code smells are somewhat vaguely defined.
- Structures similar to code smells are described by Brown et al. (1998), who discuss software anti-patterns. These anti-patterns describe code problems on class to architectural levels. Some of them are similar to code smells, e.g., God Class is equal to a Large Class smell and Lava Flow is a synonym for Dead Code. However, the scope of their work is quite wide as they also discuss problems in software processes, badly behaving developers, and many other areas.
- The Air Force Operation Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) pamphlet (AFOTEC, 1996) provides a rich set of instructions for evaluating software maintainability.
- In this section we introduce the 23 code smells that we surveyed. Twenty-two of the code smells were introduced by Fowler and Beck (2000). Additionally, we included a code smell for dead code, i.e., code that is never executed, as we felt it was important but not included in the list by Fowler and Beck. In the rest of the paper we will use a bold font when referring to the smells, e.g., Dead Code. We chose four smells for automatic code analysis, namely Large Class, Long Method, Long Parameter List, and Duplicate Code. We selected these because we thought their operationalization would be quite straightforward, and because we had suitable tools to measure them.
- One key assumption of code smells is that there are no exact conditions, which indicate when developers should improve the software design.
**** [[http://mikamantyla.eu/BadCodeSmellsTaxonomy.html][A Taxonomy for "Bad Code Smells"]]
***** The Bloaters
- Long Parameter List
- Long Method
- Large Class
- Primitive Obsession
- Data Clumps

Bloater smells represents something that has grown so large that it cannot be effectively handled.
It seems likely that these smells grow a little bit at a time. Hopefully nobody designs, e.g., Long Methods.
Primitive Obsession is actually more of a symptom that causes bloats than a bloat itself. The same holds for Data Clumps. When a Primitive Obsession exists, there are no small classes for small entities (e.g. phone numbers). Thus, the functionality is added to some other class, which increases the class and method size in the software. With Data Clumps there exists a set of primitives that always appear together (e.g. 3 integers for RGB colors). Since these data items are not encapsulated in a class this increases the sizes of methods and classes.
***** The Object-Orientation Abusers
- Switch Statements
- Temporary Field
- Refused Bequest
- Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces

When a solution does not fully exploit the possibilities of object-oriented design.
For example, a Switch Statement might be considered acceptable or even good design in procedural programming, but is something that should be avoided in object-oriented programming. The situation where switch statements or type codes are needed should be handled by creating subclasses. Refused Bequest smells lack proper inheritance design, which is one of the key elements in object-oriented programming. The Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces smell lacks a common interface for closely related classes, so it can also be considered a certain type of inheritance misuse. The Temporary Field smell means a case in which a variable is in the class scope, when it should be in method scope. This violates the information hiding principle.

***** The Change Preventers
- Divergent Change
- Shotgun Surgery
- Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies

Change Preventers are smells is that hinder changing or further developing the software. These smells violate the rule suggested by Fowler and Beck which says that classes and possible changes should have a one-to-one relationship. For example, changes to the database only affect one class, while changes to calculation formulas only affect the other class.

The Divergent Change smell means that we have a single class that needs to be modified by many different types of changes. With the Shotgun Surgery smell the situation is the opposite, we need to modify many classes when making a single change to a system (change several classes when changing database from one vendor to another)

Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies, which means a duplicated class hierarchy, was originally placed in OO-abusers. One could also place it inside of The Dispensables since there is redundant logic that should be replaced.
***** The Dispensables
- Lazy class
- Data class
- Duplicate Code
- Dead Code
- Speculative Generality

...they all represent something unnecessary that should be removed from the source code.
This group contains two types of smells (dispensable classes and dispensable code), but since they violate the same principle, we will look at them together. If a class is not doing enough it needs to be removed or its responsibility needs to be increased. This is the case with the Lazy class and the Data class smells. Code that is not used or is redundant needs to be removed. This is the case with Duplicate Code, Speculative Generality and Dead Code smells. 

***** The Couplers
- Feature Envy
- Inappropriate Intimacy
- Message Chains
- Middle Man

This group has four coupling-related smells.
One design principle that has been around for decades is low coupling (Stevens et al. 1974) . This group has 3 smells that represent high coupling. Middle Man smell on the other hand represent a problem that might be created when trying to avoid high coupling with constant delegation. Middle Man is a class that is doing too much simple delegation instead of really contributing to the application.

The Feature Envy smell means a case where one method is too interested in other classes, and the Inappropriate Intimacy smell means that two classes are coupled tightly to each other. Message Chains is a smell where class A needs data from class D. To access this data, class A needs to retrieve object C from object B (A and B have a direct reference). When class A gets object C it then asks C to get object D. When class A finally has a reference to class D, A asks D for the data it needs. The problem here is that A becomes unnecessarily coupled to classes B, C, and D, when it only needs some piece of data from class D. The following example illustrates the message chain smell: A.getB().getC().getD().getTheNeededData()

Of course, I could make an argument that these smells should belong to the Object-Orientation abusers group, but since they all focus strictly on coupling, I think it makes the taxonomy more understandable if they are introduced in a group of their own.

***** The Others 
- Comments and Incomplete
- Library Class

Other smells that were studied, but could not be included in any of the groups are Comments and Incomplete Library Class. The Comments smell indicates the misuse of comments, i.e., when a programmer uses comments to explain some piece of code instead of writing code that is simpler and more self-explaining. Incomplete Library Class means that the application is using a third party library code that is not completely adequate for the application. According to Fowler and Beck this smell can be removed, for example, by introducing a local extension.

*** Alternative Classes With Different Interfaces
*** Comments
If you need a comment to explain what a block of code does, try Extract Function (106). If the method is already extracted but you still need a comment to explain what it does, use Change Function Declaration (124) to rename it. If you need to state some rules about the required state of the system, use Introduce Assertion (302).

According to Fowler and Beck (2000), the Duplicate Code smell Bis number one in the stink parade.
Same code structure in more than one place

**** Same expression in different places 
The simplest duplicated code problem is when you have the same expression in two
methods of the same class. Then all you have to do is Extract Function and invoke the code from both places.

*** Hierarchical database model
The hierarchical database model mandates that each child record has only one parent, whereas each parent record can have one or more child records.
**** Adjacency List Model
**** Nested set model
- The model doesn't allow for multiple parent categories. For example, an 'Oak' could be a child of 'Tree-Type', but also 'Wood-Type'. An additional tagging or taxonomy has to be established to accommodate this, again leading to a design more complex than a straightforward fixed model. [SQL Antipatterns. p. 328.]

    retrieval of the data representing zero or more business entities from the database.
*** Add Trigger For Calculated Column 
    Introduce a new trigger to update the value
    contained in a calculated column.
*** Apply Standard Codes 
    Apply a standard set of code values to a single column to ensure
    that it conforms to the values of similar columns stored elsewhere in the database.
*** Apply Standard Type
    Ensure that the data type of a column is consistent with the data
    type of other similar columns within the database.
*** Consolidate Conditional Expression 
    Combine sequence of conditional tests into a
    single conditional expression and extract it.
*** Consolidate Key Strategy 
    Choose a single key strategy for an entity and apply it
    consistently throughout your database.

    Extract methods from the condition.
*** Drop Column 
    Remove a column from an existing table.
*** Drop Column Constraint 
    Remove a column constraint from an existing table.
*** Drop Default Value 
    Remove the default value that is provided by a database from an
    existing table column.
*** Drop Foreign Key Constraint 
    Remove a foreign key constraint from an existing table so

    Wrap access to an existing table with a view.
*** Extract Method 
    Turn the code fragment into a method whose name explains the
    purpose of the method.Insert Data (page 296): Insert data into an existing table.
*** Introduce Calculated Column 
    Introduce a new column based on calculations involving
    data in one or more tables.
*** Introduce Calculation Method
    Introduce a new method, typically a stored function,
    which implements a calculation that uses data stored within the database.

    appropriate "child records" when a "parent record" is deleted.
*** Introduce Column Constraint
    Introduce a column constraint in an existing table.
*** Introduce Common Format
    Apply a consistent format to all the data values in an
    existing table column.
*** Introduce Default Value

**** Motivation 
preserve all application data, typically for historical means.
**** Tradeoffs 
***** more data - table have to store valid rows and those mark as deleted 
***** performance - more data means reduction in query performace - the additional work of distinguishing between deleted and nondeleted rows
***** code complexity 
****** mostly in every query we would have to remember add 'where isDeleted = false'
****** you may have associations going from Table A to Table B and when you soft delete something from Table A, you need to ensure that independent queries on Table B take care of that fact. 
***** break immutability
ORM - objects are not deleted they are being mutated - you are modyfing data not deleting
***** break data integrity
- like a half of data in database is valid other half is invalid
- can happen - foreign key from valid to invalid data
**** How
***** Introduce New Column
****** isDeleted 
******* bool not null false 
******* date/timestamp null
***** Update 
****** application 
****** database trigger - it is simple and it avoids the risk that the applications will not update the column properly      
**** Opposite
Introduce Hard Delete
*** Introduce Surrogate Key 
Replace an existing natural key with a surrogate key.
*** Introduce Trigger For History 
Introduce a new trigger to capture data changes for historical purposes.
**** Motivation
delegate the tracking of data changes to the database itself
*** Introduce Variable 
    Put the result of the expression, or parts of the expression, in a
    temporary variable with a name that explains the purpose.
*** Introduce View 
    Create a view based on existing tables in the database.
**** Motivation
***** Summarize data for reporting. Many reports require summary data, which can be generated via the view definition.
***** Replace redundant reads. Several external programs, or stored procedures for that matter, often implement the same retrieval query. These queries can be replaced by a common readonly table or view.
***** Data security. A view can be used to provide end users with read access to data but not update privileges.
***** Encapsulate access to a table. Some organizations choose to encapsulate access to tables by defining updateable views that external programs access instead of the source tables. This enables the organization to easily perform database refactorings such as Rename Column (page 109) or Rename Table (page 113) without impacting the external applications, because views add an encapsulation layer between your tables and your application.
***** Reduce SQL duplication. When you have complex SQL queries in an application, it is common to discover that parts of the SQL are duplicated in many places. When this is the case, you should introduce views to extract out the duplicate SQL, as shown in the example section.

**** Tradeoffs
***** poor performance of the joins
***** increases the coupling with database schemas

similar to a relational database, but with an object-oriented database model: objects, classes and inheritance are directly supported in database schemas and in the query language. In addition, just as with pure relational systems, it supports extension of the data model with custom data types and methods. 

The characteristic properties of ORDBMS are 1) complex data, 2) type inheritance, and 3) object behavior. Complex data creation in most SQL ORDBMSs is based on preliminary schema definition via the user-defined type (UDT). Hierarchy within structured complex data offers an additional property, type inheritance. That is, a structured type can have subtypes that reuse all of its attributes and contain additional attributes specific to the subtype. Another advantage, the object behavior, is related with access to the program objects
** Dictionary
massive hardware injection
** ACID
*** Atomicity
Transactions are often composed of multiple statements. Atomicity guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single "unit", which either succeeds completely, or fails completely: if any of the statements constituting a transaction fails to complete, the entire transaction fails and the database is left unchanged. An atomic system must guarantee atomicity in each and every situation, including power failures, errors and crashes.

*** Consistency
Consistency ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid state to another, maintaining database invariants: any data written to the database must be valid according to all defined rules, including constraints, cascades, triggers, and any combination thereof. This prevents database corruption by an illegal transaction, but does not guarantee that a transaction is correct. Referential integrity guarantees the primary key - foreign key relationship.

*** Isolation
Transactions are often executed concurrently (e.g., multiple transactions reading and writing to a table at the same time). Isolation ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database in the same state that would have been obtained if the transactions were executed sequentially. Isolation is the main goal of concurrency control; depending on the method used, the effects of an incomplete transaction might not even be visible to other transactions.
Durability

*** Durability  
guarantees that once a transaction has been committed, it will remain committed even in the case of a system failure (e.g., power outage or crash). This usually means that completed transactions (or their effects) are recorded in non-volatile memory.

*** Notes
One of the criticisms of more raw SQL methods is that you end up with all these VOs (value objects) or DTOs (data transfer objects) that are used by simply one query. This is touted as an advantage of ORMs because you get rid of that.

Thing is those problems don't go away with ORMs, they simply move up to the presentation layer. Instead of creating VOs/DTOs for queries, you create custom presentation objects, typically one for every view. How is this better? IMHO it isn't.

TIPS
Avoid functions on an indexed columns
SELECT id, title FRMO PICTURE
WHERE YEAR(create_date) >= 2001
The index won't be used here

LIMIT

BETWEEN
AND picture.id BETWEEN 26 AND 50;
Only makes sense if that column is indexed

IN
AND picture.id IN (10,15,16)

Archive Tables?
Split Databases and tables

Remove unused index

B-Tree Index
- each leaf node contains a link to the next node for the fast range traversals
- values are stored in order
- each leaf page is at the same distance from root level
- InnoDB

- storage engine traverses from root node to leaf node with the help of pointers
- increase performance of following query patterns:
  - full value (e.g: Pluralsight, Pinal Dave)
  - leftmost value or column prefix (e.g: Plural from Pluralsight, Pinal from Pinal Dave)
  - range of value (e.g 1 to 99, AAron to Fritz, Aaron to Kei%)
- helps ORDER BY clause to increase the performance

  Clustered Index
  + rows with adjacent key values are stored close to each other
  + related data is stored close to each other leading less disk I/O while retrieving sequential or range data
  + faster data access as data and index are stored together at leaf node

  - data insertion speed is dependent on the order of the Primary Key
  - updating the clustered index column is expensive as data is moved based on its size to different on location

* Definitions
** Anemic Domain Model
- focus on data
- structured
- easy to implement and to maintain
- contains little or no logic
- no guarantee to be valid or consisten
*** use
    - prototyping
    - easy of use
    - easily generated 
** Data Clump
a set of primitives that always appear
together (e.g., three integers for RGB colours)
** Rich Domain Model
- combines data and logic 
- valid by design
- easy to test
- defined state transistions
*** use
    - clean code 
    - testability
    - truly OOP
** Characterization Test
   Test that characterizes the actual behavior of a piece of code. It acts as a change detector, protecting legacy code from unintended changes.
** Polymorphism
describes a pattern in object oriented programming in which classes have different functionality while sharing a common interface
** Parameter vs. Argument
A parameter is the variable which is part of the method’s signature (method declaration). An argument is an expression used when calling the method.

Consider the following code:
#+begin_src php
void Foo(int i, float f)
{
    // Do things
}

void Bar()
{
    int anInt = 1;
    Foo(anInt, 2.0);
}
#+end_src

Here i and f are the parameters, and anInt and 2.0 are the arguments.

https://stackoverflow.com/questions/1788923/parameter-vs-argument
** Principle vs. Practices
   - The Boy scout motto – “Be prepared”–is a timeless principle. “Buy a plunger before you need a plunger” is a practice that applies this principle in a memorable way.
   - Principles are good ideas or good values stated in a context-independent manner. Practices are applications of theses principles stated in a context-dependent way.
   - Principle: a fundamental, primary or general law or truth
   - Practice: the action or process of performing or doing something
** Logical operators  
They are used for different purposes and in fact have different operator precedences. The && and || operators are intended for Boolean conditions, whereas and and or are intended for control flow.

For example, the following is a Boolean condition:

if ($foo == $bar && $baz != $quxx) {

This differs from control flow:

doSomething() or die();
** Value Object
- measures, quantifies or describe a thing in the domain
- identity is based on composition of values
- immutable
- compared using all values
- no side effects
- value object should never be mocked
- Value objects are powerful yet simple things. The problem that we were trying to solve earlier was that we need to constantly revalidate all of our properties. We do this because at every step, we don't know whether we can trust the object's properties to be valid. What if we could? In order to trust the values, we need two characteristics: for them to be validated and a guarantee that they haven't been changed since the validation.

- Based on W.Cunningham's metaphor of complexity as debt:
  - skipping design is like borrowing money
  - refactoring is like repaying principal
  - slower development due to complexity is like paying interest
is the debt that accumulate when you knowingly or unknowingly make
wrong or non-optimal design decisions.

Here are some reasons why unused code should be removed:

- For anyone new working on a project, they not only have to understand the working code, they have to understand unused material also. This is wasted time and creates confusion.

- There is a danger that at sometime someone will make a change which inadvertently involve the 'dormant' code and can introduce bugs. I know it's happened on projects I've worked on.

- The maintenance of any code is an administrative burden. By preserving old redundant code that burden is increased. For example, merging changes in the main branch becomes harder because there is more code to work through and more possibility to make a mistake.

- What happens over time is that more and more old unused code is added to the codebase. This increases the confusion, potential misunderstanding and administrative overhead.

- The chances that the unused code will ever be used again is very unlikely. With time that possibility of re-use diminishes. If code is to be removed and is considered important enough then the code can be branched off and documented.

- Any personal feelings that a coder may have about code they may have worked hard on are understandable. But part of being professional requires that those thoughts have to be put to one side for the better good. Time stands for no-one and there is no place for preserving historical code in a working codebase.

* Practices
** Always Use 'declare(stric_types=1)'
#+BEGIN_SRC php
declare(stric_types=1);

$var  = '0';
if ( !$var ) {
   echo 'negation';
}
#+END_SRC

#+RESULTS:
: negation
** Always leave things better than you found them
boy scout rule : leave the (campground) code cleaner than you found it
** Avoid Else, Return Early (Guard Clause)
Return as soon as you know your method cannot do any more meaningful work.
#+BEGIN_SRC php
 public function foo(int $x): string
    {
        $result = null;

        if ($x === 1) {
            $result = 'a';
        } elseif ($x === 2) {
            $result = 'b';
        } else {
            $result = 'c';
        }

        return $result;
    }
#+END_SRC
#+BEGIN_SRC php
 public function foo(int $x): string
    {
        if ($x === 1) {
            return 'a';
        }

        if ($x === 2) {
            return 'b';
        }

        return 'c';
    }
#+END_SRC

Refactoring: Replace Nested Conditional with Guard Clauses
Guard clause provides an early exit from a subroutine. Removing one level of nesting and resulting in flatter code.

** Avoid Negative Conditionals
   It is much easier, for the human mind, to comprehend positive reasoning. So if you can avoid negative conditionals, you should always take that path.
#+BEGIN_SRC php
if (!count){
...
}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC php
if (count == 0){
...
}
#+END_SRC
** Don't Use 'clone'
*** https://dcsg.me/articles/dont-clone-your-php-objects-deepcopy-them/
*** TODO show example with Doctrine
** Don't Use 'else if'
   Else if is not compatible with the colon syntax for if|elseif blocks. For this reason, use elseif for conditionals
#+BEGIN_SRC php
<?php if ($user) { ?>
    <span>OK. Your registration is successful</span>
<?php } else { ?>
    <span>Something went wrong! Please try again later! </span>
<?php } ?>
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC php
 if ($user) : ?>
    <div>OK. Your registration is successful</div>
<?php else : ?>
    <div>Something went wr+ong! Please try again later!</div>
<?php endif ?>
#+END_SRC

Most of the time the alternative (endif) syntax is used in view scripts. It's often hard to see/notice the end of an if statement since a curly brace only takes up one character, when you're at the bottom of a file, it's hard to tell if it's the end of an if or a foreach. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
<?php if ($condition): ?>

    <div>a huge block of html</div>

<?php endif; ?>
#+END_SRC


https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Coding_conventions/PHP
And the latter has poorer performance.
#+BEGIN_SRC php
// This:
if ( $foo == 'bar' ) {
	echo 'Hello world';
} else if ( $foo == 'Bar' ) {
	echo 'Hello world';
} else if ( $baz == $foo ) {
	echo 'Hello baz';
} else {
	echo 'Eh?';
}

// Is actually equivalent to:
if ( $foo == 'bar' ) {
	echo 'Hello world';
} else {
	if ( $foo == 'Bar' ) {
		echo 'Hello world';
	} else {
		if ( $baz == $foo ) {
			echo 'Hello baz';
		} else {
			echo 'Eh?';
		}
	}
}

** Don't Use Globals
   EVIL in pure form ;)
** Don't Use Magic Numbers
   Raw numbers in code. Like 86400 - that's a number of seconds per day. But it is not so obvious for every one whats that number means
Refactoring: Replace Magic Number with Symbolic Constant
** Don't Use Method Chaining Syntax
   Violating CQS
** Don't Use Optional Dependencies
   Use Constructor Injection not Setter Injection. Constructor Injection gives you a valid object with all its dependencies, upon construction.
** Don't Use Switch Parameter
   A method runs different code depending on the values of an parameter
   Refactoring: Replace Parameter with Method
** Don't Use Traits
   Further Reading: https://dev.to/barryosull/why-i-dont-like-traits
** Eliminate or Reduce Number of Comments
** Eliminate or Reduce Number of Parameters
Functions should have a small number of arguments. No argument is best, followed by one, two, and three. More than three is very questionable and should be avoided with prejudice.

** Sprout Class
** Sprout Method
   When adding new functionality, write the code in a new method with TDD and then call this method from the old code. So even if you can’t test the code where your method is being called, at least the new code has tests.
1. Identify where you need to make your code change.
2. If the change can be formulated as a single sequence of statements in one place in a method, write down a call for a new method that will do the work involved and then comment it out. (I like to do this before I even write the method so that I can get a sense of what the method call will look like in context.) 
3. Determine what local variables you need from the source method, and make them arguments to the call. 
4.Determine whether the sprouted method will need to return values to source method. If so, change the call so that its return value is assigned to a variable. 
5. Develop the sprout method using test-driven development. 
6. Remove the comment in the source method to enable the call.
** Use parentheses
   Parentheses help clarify the order of operators...etc. PHP won’t get confused if you don’t use parentheses because it knows the order of operators table very well. However, a person looking at your program has to figure out which is done first, and parentheses help group operations together.
#+BEGIN_SRC php
if (age < 20 || sales < 1200 && hrsWorked > 15) {}
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC php
if ((age < 20) || ((sales < 1200) && (hrsWorked > 15))) {}
#+END_SRC
** Wrap Class
   Choosing to use Wrap Class is a whole other issue. There is a higher thresh- old for this pattern. Generally two cases tip me toward using Wrap Class: 1. The behavior that I want to add is completely independent, and I don’t want to pollute the existing class with behavior that is low level or unre- lated. 2. The class has grown so large that I really can’t stand to make it worse. In a case like this, I wrap just to put a stake in the ground and provide a roadmap for later changes.
** Wrap Method
** Naming
*** variable
*** method
   - isX() or hasX() for bool return type
*** snake_case
**** Clients must use API with snake_case (keys in JSON object sent in request body are in snake_case).
**** Database column names are also snake_case.

Based on an eye tracking study on camelCase and snake_case (PDF) from 2010, snake_case is 20% easier to read than camelCase!

| name             | psr                                       | comunnity   | description |
| method names     | camelCase() 21/22. lower_under 1/22       | camelCase() |             |

* Principles
** SOLID
  There is a strong relationship beetween each of those principles. If you take each of those principles in isolation and try to apply them in your codebase you will get limited benefit out of that. it's only when you take enterly package apply it in it entarity. Applying it all at once. Strong sinergy efect.
*** Single Responsibilty (SRP)
A class should have only one reason to change - doing one thing, and do it well The object should be able to do the job completely The class has only one well-defined responsibility which is exclusively handling user data. No more, no less.
*** Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification. Interface is open for extension but closed for modification.
*** Liskov Substitution (LSP)
Metody do klas bazowych, muszą być w stanie używać również obiektów klas dziedziczących po klasach bazowych.	Program to an, interface, not an implementation.
*** Interface Segregation (ISP)
A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
*** Dependency Inversion (DIP)
Depend on abstractions, not concretions. Program to an, interface, not an implementation.

*** Model-View-Controller
• The Model: Captures and centralizes all the domain model behaviour. This layer manages all the data, logic and business rules independently of the data representation. It can be said that the Model layer is the heart and soul of every MVC application. • The Controller: Orchestrates interactions between the other layers. Triggers actions on the model in order to update its state and refreshes the representations associated to the model. Additionally, the Controller can also send messages to the View layer in order to change the specific Model representation. • The View: A layer whose main purpose is to expose the differing representations of the Model layer and to give a way to trigger changes on the Model’s state.

***** [[https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-01.txt][HTTP Semantics]]

****** DELETE
If a DELETE method is successfully applied, the origin server SHOULD send a 202 (Accepted) status code if the action will likely succeed but has not yet been enacted, a 204 (No Content) status code if the action has been enacted and no further information is to be supplied, or a 200 (OK) status code if the action has been enacted and the response message includes a representation describing the status.

****** PATCH
???


***** Sorting
We can also add a sort parameter to sort by field. The sort field in turn contains a list of
comma separated columns to sort on; the first in the list is the highest sort priority. In order
to negatively sort you prefix a column with a negative sign -
GET /tickets?sort=-amount: sort orders by descending order of amount
(highest first).
GET /tickets?sort=-amount,created_at: sort orders by descending order
of amount (highest first). Within those amounts (with orders of equal amounts),
older orders are listed first.

***** Searching
We can then search using a simple parameter that applies a search query that can then be
routed through a search service (for example, ElasticSearch).
Suppose we want to search orders for the phrase refund, we can define a field for search
queries:
GET /orders?q=refund

***** Limiting fields
Additionally, using a fields parameter we can query for specific fields:
GET /orders?fields=amount,created_at,customer_name,shipping_address
**** How to pack data
https://jsonapi.org/format/


A JSON object MUST be at the root of every JSON:API request and response containing data. This object defines a document’s “top level”.

A document MUST contain at least one of the following top-level members:

data: the document’s “primary data”
errors: an array of error objects
meta: a meta object that contains non-standard meta-information.

The members data and errors MUST NOT coexist in the same document.

    Creation of objects themselves - separate the construction of a complex object from its representation
**** Factory
     Separating the creation of an object from the actual implementation. If creating the object is a complicated job you can do all of the work in the factory, instead of repeating it every time you want to create a new instance.

**** Dependency Injection
A class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. It's a method of decoupling code & following the Dependency Inversion principle.
***** Types of injection:
****** Construction injection: 
       dependencies are injected when creating the object. It can be used for required and optional dependencies.
****** Setter injection: 
       dependencies are injected through setters, and they are always optional.
****** Property injection: 
       dependencies are injected directly through public properties. This type of injection is not recommended as there is no control at all of what is being injected.

*** Structural
    They act as interconnectors between entities. It serves as a blueprint for how basic classes can be combined to form bigger  entities. Structural patterns describe the static architecture of a design;

**** Bridge
  The Bridge pattern can be quite straightforward; it effectively allows us to decouple an abstraction from an implementation so the two can vary independently.

**** Facade
- A Facade is meant to decouple a client and a sub-system by embedding many (but sometimes just one) interface, and of course to reduce complexity.
- That’s why a good facade has no new in it. If there are multiple creations for each method, it is not a Facade, it’s a Builder or a [Abstract|Static|Simple] Factory [Method].
- The best facade has no new and a constructor with interface-type-hinted parameters. If you need creation of new instances, use a Factory as argument.
- A Facade design pattern works providing a single class that in itself instantiates other classes and provides a simple interface to use those functions. A warning when using such pattern is that, as classes are instantiated within the Facade, you are essentially tightly coupling the classes that it utilizes. There are cases where you want this, but there are cases where you do not. Where do you do not want this behavior, you are better suited to using dependency injection. I have found this to be useful when wrapping a set of poor APIs into a single unified API. It reduces external dependencies, allowing complexity to be internalized; this process can make your code more readable. In other situations, where the various classes were loosely coupled together, we may find it better to use dependency injection. By injecting objects that perform various actions into the ToyFactory class we can benefit from making testing easier by being able to inject fake classes that the ToyFactory class can manipulate. Personally, I am a huge believer in making code as easily testable as possible; hence why I don't like this approach.

**** Composite
To treat a group of objects the same way as a single instance of the object.


Composite Imagine an audio system consisting of individual songs and also playlists of songs. Yes, playlists consist of songs, but we want both to be treated individually. Both are types of music, both can be played. The Composite design pattern can help here; it allows us to ignore the differences between compositions of objects and individual objects. It allows us to treat both with identical or nearly-identical code. Let's put together a little example; a song is our example of a leaf, with playlists being composites. Music is our abstraction of playlists and songs; therefore, we can call this our component. The client of all this is our index.php file. By not discriminating between leaf-nodes and branches, our code becomes less complex and therefore less error prone.

** Architectural patterns
   This is not strictly a design pattern (but the Gang of Four didn't cover Architectural patterns
in their book); but it is incredibly relevant for PHP developers due to the web-oriented
nature of PHP. Architectural patterns address various different constraints in computer
systems through addressing performance limitations, high availability, and also
minimization of business risk.
Most developers will be familiar with the Model-View-Controller architecture when it
comes to web frameworks, more recently other architectures have started to emerge; for
example, a microservices architecture works by a set of RESTful APIs that are independent
and interconnected. Some people believe microservices move problems from the software
development layer to the systems architecture layer. The opposite of microservices often
referred to as a monolithic architecture, is where all the code is together in one application.

pros: you don’t have to specify the properties of the object and how they relate to the database. The model is able to determine the properties automatically by looking at the schema of the database.
*** Data Transfer Object DTO
"a class with public variables and no functions" clean code p. 100. 
But in PHP we still can't declare type of variable, just type-hint parameters of methods. Like setters, so we can do it indirectly. Another great benefit it the standard rule is to not have public properties so we can stay consisten with this one. But more of great adventage of if we can make our DTO object immutable. So create only getters, without setters. Add all in constructor.

**** Controllers
- are what the user interacts with
- they receive a request from the user, decide what to do, and send request back
- it's the only component that interacts with the models

- classes that are designed to work with information in your database
- are where an anpplication's data are stored
- responsible for storing and retrieving data
- know nothing about the user interface
**** Views
- are what the user sees on the screen
- they present the data to the user
- kno nothing about the models
**** Why use MVC?
- business logic separate from presentation: Separation Of Concerns
- developer specialisation
  - designers can focus on the front end without worrying about the business logic
  - developers of the models can focus on the business logic or back end without worrying about the look and feel
**** Front controller
- provide a central entry point for all request. All request are sent through one page 
**** Action suffix
***** _call is exectued for a non-existent or non-public method call
***** Stack
      No it wasn't just a naming convention. It was used to execute some code before or after every controller 'action' method. Like checking is user has logged in. 
   It is based on magic __call function which is executed for a non-existent or non-public method call.

*** MVVM
    Magento was here.
** Antipatterns
*** God objects
 Essentially, a God object is an object with either too many methods or too many properties;
 essentially, it's a class that knows too much or does too much. The God object soon becomes
 tightly coupled to (referenced by) lots of other bits of code in the application.
 So what's actually wrong with this? Well, in short, when you have one bit of code tied into
 every single other bit of code, you quickly find a maintenance disaster. If you adjust the
 logic for a method in a God object for one use case, you might find it having unintended
 consequences for another element.

 The flip side to God objects being an anti-pattern is when developing embedded systems.
 Embedded systems are used to process data on anything from a calculator to LED signage;
 they are small chips that are essentially self-contained computers and quite low cost. In this
 use case, with restricted computational power you can often find that programming
 elegance and maintainability become peripheral concerns. Slight performance increase and
 centralization of control can be more important, meaning using God objects can be
 somewhat sensible. Fortunately, PHP is incredibly seldom used to program embedded
 systems, so you are incredibly unlikely to find yourself in this particular situation.

 Another anti-pattern, called Fear of Adding Classes,
*** Singleton
 <?php
 class{
 Singleton
 private static $instance;
 public static function getInstance()
 {
 if (null === static::$instance) {
 static::$instance = new static();
 }
 }
 return static::$instance;
 protected function __construct()
 {
 }
 private function __clone()
 {
 }
 private function __wakeup()
 {
 }
 }

 So here are the reasons why this should be avoided:
 They are inherently tightly coupled meaning they are difficult to test, for example
 using unit tests. They even maintain their state throughout the life cycle of the
 application.
 They violate the Single Responsibility Principle by controlling their own creation
 and life cycle.
 Fundamentally, it results in you hiding the dependencies of your application in a
 global instance. You can no longer effectively follow your dependencies around
 your code as you can't follow where they are injected as function arguments.
 They make it ineffective to find the dependency chain should you need to
 analyze it.


  Objects should typically be self-contained; they should
 only know problems about themselves and also should only solve one set of problems, its
 own problems. Anything that isn't relevant to this aim doesn't belong in that class.

*** Database as IPC
https://blog.engineyard.com/5-subtle-ways-youre-using-mysql-as-a-queue-and-why-itll-bite-you
 Let me clear this up for you; your database isn't a message queuing system. You don't use it
 schedule jobs or queue up tasks to be completed. If you need something to do that, use a
 queuing system. Your database is for data...the clue is in the name; don't shove temporary
 messages in there.
 There are many reasons why this is a bad idea. One major issue is the fact that in databases
 there is no real way to not enforce a policy by which you can guarantee that a double-read
 will not occur, and that is by utilizing row locks. This in turn, results in processes (either
 incoming out outgoing) being blocked, which in turn results in processing only being able
 to be done in a serial fashion.
 Furthermore, in order to check if there is any work to do you end up essentially counting
 the rows of data in the database to see if there is work to do; you run this on a continuous
 basis. MySQL doesn't support push notifications; unlike PostgreSQL it doesn't have the
 NOTIFY command to pair with a LISTEN channel.
 Also note that when you merge a job queue with a database table that stores real data, you
 also invalidate the cache every time you complete a job and update a flag, in turn making
 MySQL far slower.
 In short, it results in your database performing worse and can force it to slow critical
 messages to a standstill. You must be careful not to turn your database into a job queue by
 having this functionality sneak up on you; instead, use the database exclusively for data,
 and bear this in mind when extending your database.
 RabbitMQ provides an open source queuing system with some great PHP SDKs.

 Interface Bloat
 Interfaces shouldn't contain thousands of methods that reference internal operations of the
 class. They should be lightweight and considered a way of guaranteeing that when
 something is queried that it is definitely there.

 Interfaces should be used sparingly; do you actually need an interface if the class is only
 ever going to be implemented once and once alone (and realistically, no one is never going
 to need to tamper with such code?). If so, you might want to consider avoiding an interface
 in such a situation.

 So, let me draw you to one implementation of Interface Bloat. Let's take a look at the
 Pheanstalk interface class in the Pheanstalk open source library (note I have stripped the
 comments to make it more readable):
 <?php
 namespace Pheanstalk;
 interface PheanstalkInterface
 {
 const DEFAULT_PORT = 11300;
 const DEFAULT_DELAY = 0;
 const DEFAULT_PRIORITY = 1024;
 const DEFAULT_TTR = 60;
 const DEFAULT_TUBE = 'default';
 public function setConnection(Connection $connection);
 public function getConnection();
 public function bury($job, $priority = self::DEFAULT_PRIORITY);
 public function delete($job);
 [ 49 ]
 Anti-Patterns
 public function ignore($tube);
 public function kick($max);
 public function kickJob($job);
 public function listTubes();
 public function listTubesWatched($askServer = false);
 public function listTubeUsed($askServer = false);
 public function pauseTube($tube, $delay);
 public function resumeTube($tube);
 public function peek($jobId);
 public function peekReady($tube = null);
 public function peekDelayed($tube = null);
 public function peekBuried($tube = null);
 public function put($data, $priority = self::DEFAULT_PRIORITY, $delay =
 self::DEFAULT_DELAY, $ttr = self::DEFAULT_TTR);
 public function putInTube($tube, $data, $priority =
 self::DEFAULT_PRIORITY, $delay = self::DEFAULT_DELAY, $ttr =
 self::DEFAULT_TTR);
 public function release($job, $priority = self::DEFAULT_PRIORITY,
 $delay = self::DEFAULT_DELAY);
 public function reserve($timeout = null);
 public function reserveFromTube($tube, $timeout = null);
 public function statsJob($job);
 public function statsTube($tube);
 public function stats();
 public function touch($job);
 public function useTube($tube);
 public function watch($tube);
 public function watchOnly($tube);
 }
 Yuck! Notice how even constants have been put in the implement, the one thing you might
 actually want to change. Clearly, this is an interface for a class that can only be
 implemented one way, making the Interface useless.


 Bloated optimization
 Often, developers may trip over themselves trying to optimize their code or their design
 artifacts to a ridiculous extent, often before their code even performs basic functions, or
 even before any code has been created at all. This can rapidly perform issues in production.
 In this section, I wish to discuss three anti-patterns specifically relating to this topic:
 Analysis paralysis
 Bikeshedding
 Premature optimization
 [ 62 ]
 Anti-Patterns
 Analysis paralysis
 In short, this is where a strategy is over-analyzed to the point where progress is slowed
 down, or even stopped entirely in extreme cases. Not only can such solutions become
 obsolete rapidly, they can be made in under-educated circumstances, for example, in a
 meeting where an over-analytic boss tries to dig too deep into detail in advance without
 allowing their developers to actually do some research.
 Over-analyzing a problem and seeking a perfect solution upfront just does not work;
 programmers should seek to refine their solution, not come up with the refined solution up
 front.
 Bikeshedding
 Essentially, this is where analysis paralysis can occur on the basis of some very trivial
 decisions, for example, the color of a log in page. The only fix that's required is to not waste
 time on trivial decisions. Avoid design by committee where possible as the majority of
 people, regardless of how good they think their design skills are, are largely incompetent at
 design.
 Premature optimization
 In this section, so far, I've largely beaten up project managers; no time to beat up
 developers. Often, developers will seek to optimize their code prematurely without having
 educated data-led conclusions to drive where and when optimizations should be made.
 Writing clean and readable code is your first priority; then you can use some great profiling
 tools to determine where your bottlenecks are. XDebug and New Relic are just some of the
 tools that are good at this.
 That said, there are some cases where optimization must be done, particularly on some long
 computational tasks where it can be mission-critical to reduce something from O(N2) time
 to O(N). This said, most simple PHP web apps will have no real need to use this
 consideration.
*** Is storing types in the database an anti pattern?
You're then binding the type name to outside data, limiting your refactoring capabilities and making people change stuff in two places when they make a new class.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/336958/how-bad-is-it-to-store-class-and-assembly-names-in-the-database
My hesitation over doing this is that I think it introduces a higher degree of coupling between the layers.

** Notes 
There are numerous benefits to writing unit tests; they help with regression, provide documentation, and facilitate good design. 

Two Approach
Test First 
Test After

Test doubles are tools you can use when you need to create substitute dependencies]

Legacy codebases are not ready for isolated unit tests.

ARRANGE-ACT-ASSERT
a pattern for arranging and formatting code in UnitTest methods:
Each method should group these functional sections, separated by blank lines:
Arrange all necessary preconditions and inputs.
Act on the object or method under test.
Assert that the expected results have occurred.

'bit by bit you rewrite your code to be testable'

A double is a substitue for a real dependency

Assertions base test - most framework

dummies, spies, stubs, mocks, fakes

dummies - a stand-in for a dependency when class signatures or functionality don't matter, like PHP stdObject - but fail on type hints :/
stubs - substitue for a dependency and it matches the class signature, use stubs if you use type hints
mocks - a stub that uses the framework tools - most common

fakes - dependency built without the use of framework tools

feedback loop

'your decision to not build systems to catch mistakes will cost you more money

Chris???

https://github.com/opencfp/opencfp

Dependencies that you are unable to set at runtime can cause a problem ->

What to test ?
Critical Functionality - First the most valuable parts - like register form if it ncessary.
Bug Fixes - Every Bug that was found.
New Features - New Functionality

https://github.com/kahlan/kahlan

- use real dependencies when you can
- when you can't use real dependencies, try test doubles
- if you have significant amounts of code that would be burdensome to refactor, consider monkey patching
- keep doubles in sync with real dependencies


Manual or Automate Testing

-avoid regressions

Permutations != Execution Paths - you only nee to write a test case for each execution path, not for each permutation.
The number of possible paths grows with each new decision branch.

https://www.brandonsavage.net/dont-write-useless-unit-tests/

http://www.ifdattic.com/mock-test-double-using-prophecy/

http://stakeholderwhisperer.com/posts/2015/1/economy-of-tests

First, create the test.
Second, write the minimum amount of code to get that test to pass.
And third, now that your tests are passing, you can safely refactor your code to make it fancier.

Test. Code. Refactor.

You should write the tests first and then write your code.

unit - test one specific method on a class. Fake any needed database connections. One class in complete isolation.

integration - just like a unit test. Except it uses the real database connection.

functional - write a test to command a browser. Browser surfs your site, clicks links, fills out forms & asserts things is sees on the page. Testing the interface that users actually use!


Mock services. But don't mock simple model objects.

Let me say it a different way: if you're organizing your code well, then all classes will fall into one of two types. The first type - a model class - is a class whose job is basically to hold data... but not do much work. Our entities are model classes. The second type - a service class - is a class whose main job is to do work, but it doesn't hold much data, other than maybe some configuration. DinosaurFactory is a service class.

As a rule, you will want to mock service classes, but you do not need to mock model classes. Why not? Well, you can... but usually it's overkill. Since model classes tend to be simple and just hold data, it's easy enough to create those objects and set their data to whatever you want.

https://github.com/humbug/humbug

https://github.com/beberlei/assert

You need tests; yes, automated tests can be slow to write, but they are crucial for ensuring
things don't break when you rewrite or refactor them.

** Why?
*** Less coupled code
When code is tightly coupled, it can be difficult to unit test. Without creating unit tests for the code that you're writing, coupling may be less apparent.
Writing tests for your code will naturally decouple your code, because it would be more difficult to test otherwise.

**** MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior
***** MethodName - method name that being tested
***** StateUnderTest - input value
***** ExpectedBehaviour - what methods returns for specified input
**** Feature to be tested: Many suggests that it is better to simply write the feature to be tested because one is anyway using annotations to identify method as test methods. It is also recommended for the reason that it makes unit tests as alternate form of documentation and avoid code smells. Following is how tests in first example would read like if named using this technique:
***** IsNotAnAdultIfAgeLessThan18
***** FailToWithdrawMoneyIfAccountIsInvalid
***** StudentIsNotAdmittedIfMandatoryFieldsAreMissing
*** Types of Test Doubles:
**** Dummy 
Used only as a placeholder when an argument needs to be filled in.
**** Stub 
Provides fake data to the System Under Test
**** Spy
Records information about how it is used, and can provide that information back to the test.
**** Mock
Defines an expectation on how it will be used, and with what parameters. Will cause a test to fail automatically if the expectation isn’t met.
**** Fake
An actual implementation of the contract, but is unsuitable for production.

1) Accurate predictions are an oxymoron in the real world. You can't predict accurately for things that aren't certain, and in almost all cases, developers won't know the systems they are dealing with fully enough. Moreover, they don't know their own personal efficiency from day to day; it just can't be foreseen accurately.
2) A good property of software is the ability to change 
3) Anyone can take a chance at improving code, but refactoring brings a discipline of safely making changes (with tests) and leveraging the knowledge accumulated by the software development community (through refactorings).
4) After all, like beauty, complexity is in the eye of the beholder. 
5) Using new programming languages will bring you new insights and ideas to already known languages. You get a better understanding.
6) It's not about clever, crAFTY, PREETY CODE. iT'S ABOUT FAST AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION. It's about communication beetween people.
7) Any time someone sees some code that isn't as clear as  it should be, they should take the opportunity to fix it right there and then — or at least within a few minutes. This opportunistic refactoring is referred to by Uncle Bob as following the boy-scout rule — always leave the code behind in a better state than you found it.
8) software bugs are domiated by state
9) where software complexity comes from?
10) HN is fast because it is feature-barren.
11) The advantages of less lines of code are evident: a smaller program contains less bugs, is easier to reason about, and – because of its simplicity – is more robust.
12) Extracting statistical information from hundreds of processes without adversely affecting their performance is not a simple task.

Great job on the implementation!

For larger training jobs, wondering if it's worthwhile to investigate implementing SplFixedArray in to the class? While I'm not sure of the PHP7 impacts, for PHP < 7 this resulted in a memory reduction of 144 bytes per array element to 56 bytes per array element.

If you were working with 50M data points total, this would reduce the memory requirements from 7.2GB to 2.8GB.
*** As opposed with isset(), property_exists() returns TRUE even if the property has the value NULL.
*** isset() vs array_key_exist
In simple terms, isset() checks whether a variable exists or its been declared or not. This can be anything, an array, a particular key in an array or a variable. It also checks if a declared variable, array or array key has null value, if it does, isset() returns false, it returns true otherwise.

On the other hand, array_key_exists() checks whether a particular key or index exists in an array. It does not evaluate the value of the key for any null values. It returns false if it does not find the key in the array and true otherwise.

from the PHP manual: isset() does not return TRUE for array keys that correspond to a NULL value, while array_key_exists() does

It’s also easy to believe that acquiring new stuff is more important than organizing old stuff. After all, organizing old stuff does not add value. It’s acquiring new stuff that counts. So if there’s any spare time, or spare effort, or spare energy, it should be directed towards acquiring new stuff. Organizing the old stuff is a waste.

** Routing
from most specific at the top to less specific at the bottom
*** yml vs. annotations
It's always have been a war about this. But I would simply divide them in to two options. Using annotations is quickier and kind of easier to use but it's increase noise in the code. I think it's great for prototyping small application, when you absolutly sure that app would not grow. Annotations become a tottaly mess when you have big application, it's hard to manage all routing compare to central routing like yaml.
So I would go with word prototyping. Doctrine it's kind the same. It's great for prototyping but when you application finally reach maximum of what can you squize from ORM, you would have to leave it to pure SQL.

** Security
*** Cross-Site Request Forgery CSRF  
also known as XSRF, Sea Surf or Session Riding
is an attack that forces an end user to execute unwanted actions on a web application in which they're currently autheniticated.
**** GET
GET http://bank.com/transer.do?to=Attacker&amount=100 HTTP/1.1
<a href="http://bank.com/transer.do?to=Attacker&amount=100"> View my picture! </a>
<img src="http://bank.com/transer.do?to=Attacker&amount=100" witdth="0", height="0", border="0">

Next, he can distribute the hyperlink via email to a large number of bank customers. Those who click on the link while logged into their bank account will unintentionally initiate the $100 transfer.

Note that if the bank’s website is only using POST requests, it’s impossible to frame malicious requests using a <a> href tag. However, the attack could be delivered in a <form> tag with automatic execution of the embedded JavaScript.
This is how such a form may look like:
**** POST
POST http://bank.com/transer.do HTTP/1.1
#+BEGIN_SRC html
<body onload="document.forms[0].submit()">
  <form action="http://netbank.com/transfer.do" method="POST">
    <input type="hidden" name="acct" value="Attacker"/>
    <input type="hidden" name="amount" value="$100"/>
    <input type="submit" value="View my pictures!"/>
  </form>

** Metrics
*** Cyclomatic Complexity Number (CCN) 
Counts the available decision paths in a source code to determine it's complexity.
Each decision path starts with one of the conditional statements from the following list:
- ?
- &&
- ||
- or
- and
- xor
- case
- catch
- elseif
- for
- foreach
- if
- while

  Cyclomatic Complexity Number is never less than 1, because there’s always at least one code path.
  - 1-4 has low complexity.
  - 5-7 is moderate and still easy to understand.
  - 6-10 has a high complexity.
  - 10+ is very complex and hard to understand.
#+BEGIN_SRC php
final class CyclomaticComplexityNumber
{
    // Class Cyclomatic Complexity = 1
}

final class CyclomaticComplexityNumber
{

    public function one()
    {
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 1
    }

    public function two()
    {
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 1
    }

    // Class Cyclomatic Complexity = 1
}

final class CyclomaticComplexityNumber
{

    public function one()
    {
        if(true){

        }
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 2
    }

    public function two()
    {
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 1
    }

    // Class Cyclomatic Complexity = 1 + 1 = 2
}

final class CyclomaticComplexityNumber
{

    public function one()
    {
        if(true){

        }
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 2
    }

    public function two()
    {
        if(true){

        }
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 2
    }

    // Class Cyclomatic Complexity = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
}
#+END_SRC

*** NPath Complexity
#+BEGIN_SRC php
function foo($a, $b)
{
    if ($a > 10) {
        echo 1;
    } else {
        echo 2;
    }
    if ($a > $b) {
        echo 3;
    } else {
        echo 4;
    }
}
#+END_SRC
So here we have function with 4 possible outcomes, since we have 2 statements that have 2 possible outcomes each (2 * 2 = 4). That means that the functions Npath complexity is 4. If we would add another statement with 2 possible outcomes we would get a complexity of 8 since 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

Dziękuje każdemu za cenne wskazówki i uwagi, każdy po troszę ma rację. Myślę, że nie ma tutaj wzorowego rozwiązania. Mnie osobiście raził pewien 'dysonanspoznawczy' że klasa nazywa się 'NextDateTimeGreaterThanPreviousValidator' natomiast na return jest sprawdzane czy 'poprzednia data jest mniejsza od następnej' spójnie z nazwą byłoby sprawdzić czy 'nastęþna data jest większa od poprzedniej'. Chociaż po sugestiach innych, ta moja uwaga wydaje się błahostką.  
#+begin_src php

    /**
     ,* @param Collection|Carbon[] $dates

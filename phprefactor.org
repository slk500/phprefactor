  W biznesie panuje ciągłe przekonanie, że dany kod jest zasobem, gotowym produktem, który po wytworzeniu możemy odłożyć na półkę i spokojnie czekać na jego spożycie, zużycie, sprzedaż.

  1. Dodajemy tylko te funkcjonalności które są używane przez użytkowników - jaki procent? i w jakim czasie ? np. 5% w przeciągu 1 roku.

* coupling
  Tight coupling means classes and objects are dependent on one another. In general, tight coupling is usually not good because it reduces the flexibility and re-usability of the code while Loose coupling means reducing the dependencies of a class that uses the different class directly.

   myślałem o tym ale intencjonalnie zrobiłem integer bo nazwy zakładek w menu ulegają zmianą, więc np. jeśli 'SUPPORT_PROGRAMS' w bazie - 'support_program' zmieni nazwę na np. 'MARIO_BROTHERS' to wtedy w bazie musiałbyś robić migrację - bo zostanie 'support_program'. A tak jak jest int to elegancko zrobimy tylko zmianę nazwy zmiennej bez migracji bazy. Jak myślisz?

- the examples are trying to be as much short & simple as they can.
- In most cases, there are still problems with the code at the end, but fixing these problems requires other refactorings.
- Don't take any of these examples as suggestions for how to design objects. These examples are there only to illustrate the refactorings, nothing more.
- I use int to represent monetary values. I've done this only to make the examples simpler, as the representation is not important to the refactoring. In commercial software use the Quantity pattern.

*** Replace Temp with Query
 Smell: Using a temporary variable to hold the result of an expression.
 Damage: Temporary variable increase the temptation to write longer methods. Temporaries aren’t necessarily bad, but sometimes they attract new code.

 #+END_SRC
**** Write a test that pass
**** Refactor the code 
     Extract the expression into a method. Replace all references to the temp with the expression. The new method can then be used in other methods.

public function getTotalPrice(): int

public function getBasePrice(): int
{
    $this->quantity * $this->itemPrice;
}
 #+END_SRC
**** Pass a test
**** Info 
     Now, but wait, you might say. Isn't this more inefficient? Because if we created the temp the old way, we'd only have to execute the expression once, but if we turn it into a method, we might be calling it many different times. And yes, you're absolutely right, but remember, the pure efficiency of the code is not our first goal in refactoring. Clarity is. The likelihood is that a typical expression you would deal with in this sort of refactoring is going to be so undemanding, it wouldn't be noticeable at all, even having to call it several more times. But if it is an intensive operation, an intensive expression, well you should really be working on that later, after you've refactored using profilers. And other tools to make sure you're not doing pointless, premature optimization. And the real benefit is that by creating this as its own method, we will also have use of it anywhere else in the class, which wasn't the case before. As the original temp was scoped to the original method. So, we won't be tempted to add more code to the original method just to have access to that temp.

*** Refactor the code
Extract conditional code in a private method. We name the method isExpired() because our conditional chunk of code checks if the sale is expired. We create the private method isExpired() and, with the technique of extract method, we move chunks of code into the new method. The next step is to move each branch of the condition in a private method. We do the same as we did before for each branch. So we create the private method getAmountWithInterest() for the first branch and the method getAmountWithDiscount() for the second branch.

    The best practice is that if you pass parameters into a method then they should always represent what were passed in and never be reassigned to mean something else.

**** https://evhaus.medium.com/tips-on-dealing-with-technical-debt-58c6be3cf1e9
     - To me, “tech debt” is all the stuff from your past that gets in your way — preventing you from having the confidence to do your job quickly and efficiently, even if that stuff was useful at some previous time.
     - A good way to test whether your code is easy to maintain is how easy it is to delete. If you have to grep your whole codebase for some keywords, deleting individual lines of code at a time — it’s going to be a pain.

*** [[https://ericnormand.me/issues/465][465: Abstraction is the essence of programming]]
    - The answer is abstraction. Abstraction is a mapping from a concrete domain to an abstract domain. We map the days of the week (concrete domain) to the integers 1-7 (abstract domain). Then we can write useful operations on them because computers handle integers easily. After performing operations on them, we can map them back to the days of the week. We have created a model of the "days of the week" domain.

    - an html template can modify on entity
    - an entity can send an email
    - an entity can save itself to the database
    - flexibility versus maintainability
    - corrupted or meaningless data
    - design patterns
      - entity
      - repository
      - application service
      - view model
	- an object holding just the right data for the use case
      - event dispatcher
    - design that support testability
    - we know what can happen where
      - entity & application service: manage application state
      - view model: used for presentation
      - service with abstraction: used for sending emails, talking to web services, etc.

    - technical debt
      - financial metaphor
      - used to explain the impact of choosing to cut corners instead of following best practices
	- cuting corners to ship new features faster
	- it may work in short-term
	- in long term - slow people down
	- pay interest on money that you've borrowed - if you don't pay down the debt the interest will continue to accumulate and soon all your efforts will be focused on making interest payments.
      - not always taken on intentionally, but requires intentionality to pay off
      - decision to rewrite - is similar to having to declare bankruptcy
      - get test suite into state where all of the tests are passing, trust the test suite, tool to make inmprovments to the system.
      - tests out of sync
    - avoid mixing logic and formatting changes
    - remove noise & distractions
    - ready by refactoring
      - apply small refactorings while reading code
      - goal is to gain better understanding and make that understanding durable

2. Write just enough code for the test to pass
3. Refactor your code

- Automated testing follows the same steps as manual testing, but it's much quicker. While there is an initial time investment to write the scripts, once the scripts are complete they can be run repeatedly without much additional cost.
- There will be maintenance that is required, but it saves time in the long run. This makes automation have a great return on investment. In addition, the exact same steps are executed every time, which reduces any possibility of human error.

"The hardest part of building a software system is deciding precisely what to build." - Fred Brooks


If you're having trouble, example mapping helps us keep these conversations short and on track by creating a visual representation of a user story to guide and document the discussion. The process of example mapping is fairly straightforward. Using a four-color pack of index cards, we build a visual representation of our user's story with each color providing a specific piece of information. We build this as we have our conversation to document what is discovered through the discussion about the user's story.

We begin with a yellow card, which contains the name of our story itself and place this at the very top. Our blue cards represent specific rules that constrain the scope of our story. This is our acceptance criteria. With green cards, we provide concrete examples of the user's story in the context of a specific rule. So we place these under the relevant blue card. And finally, we have our red cards. These cards contain questions that cannot be immediately answered during the discussion, but are captured so that we can move on with the conversation.

***** Acceptance criteria
****** addresses what defines a working system
****** written as pass/fail
***** Scenario 
****** defines the initial conditions for acceptance criteria
****** states the trigger of scenario and expected outcome 

**** Gherkin Syntax 
***** Feature: feature story - name of the feature and possibly brief description
****** Scenario: a user story - single concrete example of how a system should behave - each feature generally have 5-20 scenarios - Scenarios describe the behaviour of the system under specific initial conditions.
****** Given: some set of initial conditions - describe the context or precondition for the scenario
****** When: an event occurs - identifies an event or actor enacted by some actor on the system
****** Then: an outcome is expected - provides the expected outcome to the scenario

**** Example
***** Feature : Customer pays with a credit card    
****** As a sales associate 
****** I should be able to process payments
****** when given a credit card

Now we're ready to translate our conversation into scenarios that describe the concrete behavior of the application. Ideally, this is done using declared dephrasing, meaning without referencing the particulars of a user interface or sequence of steps. Remember that Gherkin is a way to phrase our acceptance criteria as an executable scenario that describes the behavior of a system. So, our conversations would describe the behavior of the system under specific initial conditions.

****** Scenario 1
******* Total charge is over the $2 credit card minimum. 
******* Given: Maria orders $3 of coffee from Li. 
******* When: Maria pays with a credit card. 
******* Then:  Lit should process the payment. 

****** Scenario 2
******* Total charge is under the $2 credit card minimum.
******* Given: Maria orders $1 of coffee from Li.
******* When: Maria pays with a credit card.
******* Then: Li should not process the payment.
**** Test Automation
Allows for the execution of software tests that compare the expectations for software with the actual outcomes. Testing can be repetitive process and automation can be a boon to productivity.
  
**** Living Documentation
Is a system for dynamically generating documentation that contains information which is up to date and accurate.
Cucumber provides a system that dynamically generates documentation because of the manner that tests are written. Because Cucumber tests are written in a way that can be easily interpreted by non-technical stakeholders and, at the same time, be executed by a computer, your tests themselves become a living source of documentation that reflect the accuracy of your application. Cucumber was designed to enhance the practice of test-driven development. It provides a single source of truth for an application's lifecycle by merging test automation and test documentation.

   - lack of knowledge
   - lack of information
   - lack of processing power in brain
     It’s too hard to hold all the intermediate values of the variables and the corresponding actions in your mind at the same time.
   - A lack of knowledge means that not enough relevant facts are present in your long-term memory, the place where all your memories are permanently stored. A lack of information, on the other hand, presents a challenge for your short-term memory. Information that you are gathering has to be stored in short-term memory temporarily, but if you have to search in a lot of different places you might forget the some of the things you already read. Finally, when you must process a lot of information that takes a toll on the working memory, which is where your thinking happens.
   - You are mentally trying to execute the code, to understand what is happening. That process is called tracing—the mental compiling and executing of code. The part of the brain used to do tracing and other cognitively complex tasks is called the working memory. You can compare it to the processor of a computer, which performs calculations.

** refactoring
*** Fowler, Martin
**** [[pdf:/home/slk/Dropbox/books/Refactoring/Fowler, Martin -  Refactoring (2002).pdf::1][Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code; 1999]]
- Two of the leading proponents of refactoring are Ward Cunningham and Kent Beck.
- Ralph Johnson leads a group at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign that is notable for its practical contributions to object technology. Ralph has long been a champion of refactoring, and several of his students have worked on the topic. Bill Opdyke developed the first detailed written work on refactoring in his doctoral thesis. John Brant and Don Roberts have gone beyond writing words into writing a tool, the Refactoring Browser, for refactoring Smalltalk programs
- There's nothing wrong with a quick and dirty simple program. But if this is a representative fragment of a more complex system, then I have some real problems with this program.
- Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
- I like to get rid of temporary variables such as this as much as possible. Temps are often a problem in that they cause a lot of parameters to be passed around when they don't have to be. You can easily lose track of what they are there for. They are particularly insidious in long methods. Of course there is a performance price to pay; here the charge is now calculated twice. But it is easy to optimize that in the rental class, and you can optimize much more effectively when the code is properly factored.
- Refactoring (noun): a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.
- Refactor (verb): to restructure software by applying a series of refactorings without changing its observable behavior.
- ...purpose of refactoring is to make the software easier to understand and modify
- ...refactoring does not change the observable behavior of the software. The software still carries out the same function that it did before. Any user, whether an end user or another programmer, cannot tell that things have changed.
- I use refactoring to help me understand unfamiliar code. When I look at unfamiliar code, I have to try to understand what it does. I look at a couple of lines and say to myself, oh yes, that's what this bit of code is doing. With refactoring I don't stop at the mental note. I actually change the code to better reflect my understanding, and then I test that understanding by rerunning the code to see if it still works.
- Early on I do refactoring like this on little details. As the code gets clearer, I find I can see things about the design that I could not see before. Had I not changed the code, I probably never would have seen these things, because I'm just not clever enough to visualize all this in my head. Ralph Johnson describes these early refactorings as wiping the dirt off a window so you can see beyond. When I'm studying code I find refactoring leads me to higher levels of understanding that otherwise I would miss.
- refactoring helps you find bugs
  - ...claryfing the structure of the program
- refactoring helps you program faster
  - This sounds counterintuitive. When I talk about refactoring, people can easily see that it improves quality. Improving design, improving readability, reducing bugs, all these improve quality. But doesn't all this reduce the speed of development? I strongly believe that a good design is essential for rapid software development. Indeed, the whole point of having a good design is to allow rapid development. Without a good design, you can progress quickly for a while, but soon the poor design starts to slow you down. You spend time finding and fixing bugs instead of adding new function. Changes take longer as you try to understand the system and find the duplicate code. New features need more coding as you patchover a patch that patches a patch on the original code base. A good design is essential to maintaining speed in software development. Refactoring helps you develop software more rapidly, because it stops the design of the system from decaying. It can even improve a design.
- When Should You Refactor
  - In almost all cases, I'm opposed to setting aside time for refactoring. In my view refactoring is not an activity you set aside time to do. Refactoring is something you do all the time in little bursts. You don't decide to refactor, you refactor because you want to do something else, and refactoring helps you do that other thing.
  - The Rule of Three 
    - Here's a guideline Don Roberts gave me: The first time you do something, you just do it. The second time you do something similar, you wince at the duplication, but you do the duplicate thing anyway. The third time you do something similar, you refactor.
    - Tip: Three strikes and you refactor.
- Refactor When You Add Function
  - first reason to refactor here is to help me understand some code I need to modify
  - The other driver of refactoring here is a design that does not help me add a feature easily. I look at the design and say to myself, "If only I'd designed the code this way, adding this feature would be easy."
- Refactor When You Need to Fix a Bug
  - In fixing bugs much of the use of refactoring comes from making code more understandable. As I look at the code trying to understand it, I refactor to help improve my understanding. Often I find that this active process of working with the code helps in finding the bug. One way to look at it is that if you do get a bug report, it's a sign you need refactoring, because the code was not clear enough for you to see there was a bug.
- Refactor As You Do a Code Review
- I've found that refactoring helps me review someone else's code. Before I started using refactoring, I could read the code, understand some degree of it, and make suggestions. Now when I come up with ideas, I consider whether they can be easily implemented then and there with refactoring. If so, I refactor. When I do it a few times, I can see more clearly what the code looks like with the suggestions in place. I don't have to imagine what it would be like, I can see what it is like. As a result, I can come up with a second level of ideas that I would never have realized had I not refactored.
- You just code the first approach that comes into your head, get it working, and then refactor it into shape.
- The problem with building a flexible solution is that flexibility costs. Flexible solutions are more complex than simple ones. The resulting software is more difficult to maintain in general...
***** Chapter 3. Bad Smells in Code
- he [Kent Beck] had come up with the notion describing the "when" of refactoring in terms of smells.
- One thing we won't try to do here is give you precise criteria for when a refactoring is overdue. In our experience no set of metrics rivals informed human intuition. What we will do is give you indications that there is trouble that can be solved by a refactoring. You will have to develop your own sense of how many instance variables are too many instance variables and how many lines of code in a method are too many lines.
****** Duplicated Code 
 - number one in the stink parade.
 - same code structure in more than one place
******* Same expression in methods of the same class 
	Extract Function and invoke the code from both places.
******* Same expression in two sibling subclasses 
	You can eliminate this duplication by using Extract Method in both classes then Pull Up Field. If the code is similar but not the same, you need to use Extract Method to separate the similar bits from the different bits. You may then find you can use Form Template Method. If the methods do the same thing with a different algorithm, you can choose the clearer of the two algorithms and use Substitute Algorithm.
******* Duplicated code in two unrelated classes
	Consider using Extract Class in one class and then use the new component in the other. Another possibility is that the method really belongs only in one of the classes and should be invoked by the other class or that the method belongs in a third class that should be referred to by both of the original classes.
****** Long Method
       whenever we feel the need to comment something, we write a method instead.
       
       Ninety-nine percent of the time, all you have to do to shorten a method is Extract Method. Find parts of the method that seem to go nicely together and make a new method.
       
       If you have a method with lots of parameters and temporary variables, these elements get in the way of extracting methods. If you try to use Extract Method, you end up passing so many of the parameters and temporary variables as parameters to the extracted method that the result is scarcely more readable than the original. You can often use Replace Temp with Query to eliminate the temps. Long lists of parameters can be slimmed down with Introduce Parameter Object and Preserve Whole Object.

       If you've tried that, and you still have too many temps and parameters, it's time to get out the heavy artillery: Replace Method with Method Object.

       Conditionals and loops also give signs for extractions. Use Decompose Conditional to deal with conditional expressions. With loops, extract the loop and the code within the loop into its own method.
****** Large Class
       When a class is trying to do too much, it often shows up as too many instance variables. When a class has too many instance variables, duplicated code cannot be far behind.

       You can Extract Class to bundle a number of the variables. Choose variables to go together in the component that makes sense for each. For example, "depositAmount" and "depositCurrency"are likely to belong together in a component. More generally, common prefixes or suffixes for some subset of the variables in a class suggest the opportunity for a component. If the component makes sense as a subclass, you'll find Extract Subclass often is easier.

       Sometimes a class does not use all of its instance variables all of the time. If so, you may be able to Extract Class or Extract Subclass many times.
       
       As with a class with too many instance variables, a class with too much code is prime breeding ground for duplicated code, chaos, and death. The simplest solution...is to eliminate redundancy in the class itself. If you have five hundred-line methods with lots of code in common, you may be able to turn them into five ten-line methods with another ten two-line methods extracted from the original. As with a class with a huge wad of variables, the usual solution for a class with too much code is either to Extract Class or Extract Subclass. A useful trick is to determine how clients use the class and to use Extract Interface
****** Long Parameter List
       Use Replace Parameter with Method when you can get the data in one parameter by making a request of an object you already know about. This object might be a field or it might be another parameter. Use Preserve Whole Object to take a bunch of data gleaned from an object and replace it with the object itself. If you have several data items with no logical object, use Introduce Parameter Object.
       
       There is one important exception to making these changes. This is when you explicitly do not want to create a dependency from the called object to the larger object. In those cases unpacking data and sending it along as parameters is reasonable, but pay attention to the pain involved. If the parameter list is too long or changes too often, you need to rethink your dependency structure.
****** Divergent Change
       Divergent change occurs when one class is commonly changed in different ways for different reasons. If you look at a class and say, "Well, I will have to change these three methods every time I get a new database; I have to change these four methods every time there is a new financial instrument," you likely have a situation in which two objects are better than one. That way each object is changed only as a result of one kind of change. Of course, you often discover this only after you've added a few databases or financial instruments. Any change to handle a variation should change a single class, and all the typing in the new class should express the variation. To clean this up you identify everything that changes for a particular cause and use Extract Class to put them all together.
****** Shotgun Surgery
       Shotgun surgery is similar to divergent change but is the opposite. You whiff this when every time you make a kind of change, you have to make a lot of little changes to a lot of different classes.  When the changes are all over the place, they are hard to find, and it's easy to miss an important change.  In this case you want to use Move Method and Move Field to put all the changes into a single class. If no current class looks like a good candidate, create one. Often you can use Inline Class to bring a whole bunch of behavior together. You get a small dose of divergent change, but you can easily deal with that.  Divergent change is one class that suffers many kinds of changes, and shotgun surgery is one change that alters many classes. Either way you want to arrange things so that, ideally, there is a one-to-one link between common changes and classes.
****** Feature Envy
       The whole point of objects is that they are a technique to package data with the processes used on that data.
A classic smell is a method that seems more interested in a class other than the one it actually is in. The most common focus of the envy is the data...a method that invokes half-a-dozen getting methods on another object to calculate some value. Fortunately the cure is obvious, the method clearly wants to be elsewhere, so you use Move Method to get it there. Sometimes only part of the method suffers from envy; in that case use Extract Method on the jealous bit and Move Method...

       Of course not all cases are cut-and-dried. Often a method uses features of several classes, so which one should it live with? The heuristic we use is to determine which class has most of the data and put the method with that data. This step is often made easier if Extract Method is used to break the method into pieces that go into different places.  Of course there are several sophisticated patterns that break this rule. From the Gang of Four [Gang of Four] Strategy and Visitor immediately leap to mind. Kent Beck's Self Delegation [Beck] is another. You use these to combat the divergent change smell. The fundamental rule of thumb is to put things together that change together. Data and the behavior that references that data usually change together, but there are exceptions. When the exceptions occur, we move the behavior to keep changes in one place. Strategy and Visitor allow you to change behavior easily, because they isolate the small amount of behavior that needs to be overridden, at the cost of further indirection.
****** Data Clumps
       Data items tend to be like children; they enjoy hanging around in groups together. Often you'll see the same three or four data items together in lots of places: fields in a couple of classes, parameters in many method signatures. Bunches of data that hang around together really ought to be made into their own object. The first step is to look for where the clumps appear as fields.  Use Extract Class on the fields to turn the clumps into an object. Then turn your attention to method signatures using Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object to slim them down. The immediate benefit is that you can shrink a lot of parameter lists and simplify method calling. Don't worry about data clumps that use only some of the fields of the new object.  As long as you are replacing two or more fields with the new object, you'll come out ahead.
****** Primitive Obession
       ...using Replace Data Value with Object on individual data values. If the data value is a type code, use Replace Type Code with Class if the value does not affect behavior. If you have conditionals that depend on the type code, use Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy. If you have a group of fields that should go together, use Extract Class. If you see these primitives in parameter lists, try a civilizing dose of Introduce Parameter Object. If you find yourself picking apart an array, use Replace Array with Object.
****** Switch Statements
       One of the most obvious symptoms of object-oriented code is its comparative lack of switch (or case) statements. The problem with switch statements is essentially that of duplication. Often you find the same switch statement scattered about a program in different places. If you add a new clause to the switch, you have to find all these switch, statements and change them. The object- oriented notion of polymorphism gives you an elegant way to deal with this problem.  

Most times you see a switch statement you should consider polymorphism. The issue is where the polymorphism should occur. Often the switch statement switches on a type code. You want the method or class that hosts the type code value. So use Extract Method to extract the switch statement and then Move Method to get it onto the class where the polymorphism is needed. At that point you have to decide whether to Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy. When you have set up the inheritance structure, you can use Replace Conditional with Polymorphism.  

If you only have a few cases that affect a single method, and you don't expect them to change, then polymorphism is overkill. In this case Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods is a good option. If one of your conditional cases is a null, try Introduce Null Object.
****** Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies
       Parallel inheritance hierarchies is really a special case of shotgun surgery. In this case, every time you make a subclass of one class, you also have to make a subclass of another. You can recognize this smell because the prefixes of the class names in one hierarchy are the same as the prefixes in another hierarchy.

       The general strategy for eliminating the duplication is to make sure that instances of one hierarchy refer to instances of the other. If you use Move Method and Move Field, the hierarchy on the referring class disappears.
****** Lazy Class
       Each class you create costs money to maintain and understand. A class that isn't doing enough to pay for itself should be eliminated. Often this might be a class that used to pay its way but has been downsized with refactoring. Or it might be a class that was added because of changes that were planned but not made. Either way, you let the class die with dignity. If you have subclasses that aren't doing enough, try to use Collapse Hierarchy. Nearly useless components should be subjected to Inline Class.
****** Speculative Generality
       You get it when people say, "Oh, I think we need the ability to this kind of thing someday" and thus want all sorts of hooks and special cases to handle things that aren't required. The result often is harder to understand and maintain. If all this machinery were being used, it would be worth it. But if it isn't, it isn't. The machinery just gets in the way, so get rid of it.

       If you have abstract classes that aren't doing much, use Collapse Hierarchy. Unnecessary delegation can be removed with Inline Class. Methods with unused parameters should be subject to Remove Parameter. Methods named with odd abstract names should be brought down to earth with Rename Method.

       Speculative generality can be spotted when the only users of a method or class are test cases. If you find such a method or class, delete it and the test case that exercises it. If you have a method or class that is a helper for a test case that exercises legitimate functionality, you have to leave it in, of course.
****** Temporary Field
       Sometimes you see an object in which an instance variable is set only in certain circumstances.  Such code is difficult to understand, because you expect an object to need all of its variables.  Trying to understand why a variable is there when it doesn't seem to be used can drive you nuts.  
       
       Use Extract Class to create a home for the poor orphan variables. Put all the code that concerns the variables into the component. You may also be able to eliminate conditional code by using Introduce Null Object to create an alternative component for when the variables aren't valid.

       A common case of temporary field occurs when a complicated algorithm needs several variables.  Because the implementer didn't want to pass around a huge parameter list (who does?), he put them in fields. But the fields are valid only during the algorithm; in other contexts they are just plain confusing. In this case you can use Extract Class with these variables and the methods that require them. The new object is a method object [Beck].
****** Message Chains
       You see message chains when a client asks one object for another object, which the client then asks for yet another object, which the client then asks for yet another another object, and so on.  You may see these as a long line of getThis methods, or as a sequence of temps. Navigating this way means the client is coupled to the structure of the navigation. Any change to the intermediate relationships causes the client to have to change.  
       
       The move to use here is Hide Delegate. You can do this at various points in the chain. In principle you can do this to every object in the chain, but doing this often turns every intermediate object into a middle man. Often a better alternative is to see what the resulting object is used for.  See whether you can use Extract Method to take a piece of the code that uses it and then Move Method to push it down the chain. If several clients of one of the objects in the chain want to navigate the rest of the way, add a method to do that.
****** Middle Man
       One of the prime features of objects is encapsulation—hiding internal details from the rest of the world. Encapsulation often comes with delegation. You ask a director whether she is free for a meeting; she delegates the message to her diary and gives you an answer. All well and good.  There is no need to know whether the director uses a diary, an electronic gizmo, or a secretary to keep track of her appointments.

       However, this can go too far. You look at a class's interface and find half the methods are delegating to this other class. After a while it is time to use Remove Middle Man and talk to the object that really knows what's going on. If only a few methods aren't doing much, use Inline Method to inline them into the caller. If there is additional behavior, you can use Replace Delegation with Inheritance to turn the middle man into a subclass of the real object. That allows you to extend behavior without chasing all that delegation.
****** Inappropriate Intimacy
       Sometimes classes become far too intimate and spend too much time delving in each others'private parts. We may not be prudes when it comes to people, but we think our classes should follow strict, puritan rules.  

       Overintimate classes need to be broken up as lovers were in ancient days. Use Move Method and Move Field to separate the pieces to reduce the intimacy. See whether you can arrange a Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional. If the classes do have common interests, use Extract Class to put the commonality in a safe place and make honest classes of them. Or use Hide Delegate to let another class act as go-between.
       
       Inheritance often can lead to overintimacy. Subclasses are always going to know more about their parents than their parents w
****** Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces
       Use Rename Method on any methods that do the same thing but have different signatures for what they do. Often this doesn't go far enough. In these cases the classes aren't yet doing enough. Keep using Move Method to move behavior to the classes until the protocols are the same. If you have to redundantly move code to accomplish this, you may be able to use Extract Superclass to atone.
****** Incomplete Library Class
       Reuse is often touted as the purpose of objects. We think reuse is overrated (we just use).  However, we can't deny that much of our programming skill is based on library classes so that nobody can tell whether we've forgotten our sort algorithms. 
       
       Builders of library classes are rarely omniscient. We don't blame them for that; after all, we can rarely figure out a design until we've mostly built it, so library builders have a really tough job. The trouble is that it is often bad form, and usually impossible, to modify a library class to do something you'd like it to do. This means that tried-and-true tactics such as Move Method lie useless.
       
       We have a couple of special-purpose tools for this job. If there are just a couple of methods that you wish the library class had, use Introduce Foreign Method. If there is a whole load of extra behavior, you need Introduce Local Extension.
****** Data Class
       These are classes that have fields, getting and setting methods for the fields, and nothing else.  Such classes are dumb data holders and are almost certainly being manipulated in far too much detail by other classes. In early stages these classes may have public fields. If so, you should immediately apply Encapsulate Field before anyone notices. If you have collection fields, check to see whether they are properly encapsulated and apply Encapsulate Collection if they aren't. Use Remove Setting Method on any field that should not be changed.  

       Look for where these getting and setting methods are used by other classes. Try to use Move Method to move behavior into the data class. If you can't move a whole method, use Extract Method to create a method that can be moved. After a while you can start using Hide Method on the getters and setters. 
       
       Data classes are like children. They are okay as a starting point, but to participate as a grownup object, they need to take some responsibility.
****** Refused Bequest
       Subclasses get to inherit the methods and data of their parents. But what if they don't want or need what they are given? They are given all these great gifts and pick just a few to play with.
       
       The traditional story is that this means the hierarchy is wrong. You need to create a new sibling class and use Push Down Method and Push Down Field to push all the unused methods to the sibling. That way the parent holds only what is common. Often you'll hear advice that all superclasses should be abstract.  

       You'll guess from our snide use of traditional that we aren't going to advise this, at least not all the time. We do subclassing to reuse a bit of behavior all the time, and we find it a perfectly good way of doing business. There is a smell, we can't deny it, but usually it isn't a strong smell. So we say that if the refused bequest is causing confusion and problems, follow the traditional advice.  However, don't feel you have to do it all the time. Nine times out of ten this smell is too faint to be worth cleaning.  

       The smell of refused bequest is much stronger if the subclass is reusing behavior but does not want to support the interface of the superclass. We don't mind refusing implementations, but refusing interface gets us on our high horses. In this case, however, don't fiddle with t
****** Comments
       If you need a comment to explain what a block of code does, try Extract Method. If the method is already extracted but you still need a comment to explain what it does, use Rename Method.  If you need to state some rules about the required state of the system, use Introduce Assertion.

       Tip: When you feel the need to write a comment, first try to refactor the code so that any comment becomes superfluous.

       A good time to use a comment is when you don't know what to do. In addition to describing what is going on, comments can indicate areas in which you aren't sure. A comment is a good place to say why you did something. This kind of information helps future modifiers, especially forgetful ones
***** Chapter 4. Building Tests
- the essential precondition is having solid tests.
- I'm a pretty lazy person and am prepared to work quite hard in order to avoid work.
- In fact, one of the most useful times to write tests is before you start programming. When you need to add a feature, begin by writing the test. This isn't as backward as it sounds. By writing the test you are asking yourself what needs to be done to add the function. Writing the test also concentrates on the interface rather than the implementation (always a good thing). It also means you have a clear point at which you are done coding—when the test works.
- Now we should continue adding more tests. The style I follow is to look at all the things the class should do and test each one of them for any conditions that might cause the class to fail. This is not the same as "test every public method," which some programmers advocate. Testing should be risk driven; remember, you are trying to find bugs now or in the future. So I don't test accessors that just read and write a field. Because they are so simple, I'm not likely to find a bug there.This is important because trying to write too many tests usually leads to not writing enough. I've often read books on testing, and my reaction has been to shy away from the mountain of stuff I have to do to test. This is counterproductive, because it makes you think that to test you have to do a lot of work. You get many benefits from testing even if you do only a little testing. The key is to test the areas that you are most worried about going wrong. That way you get the most benefit for your testing effort.
***** Chapter 5. Toward a Catalog of Refactorings
- The examples are of the laughably simple textbook kind. My aim with the example is to help explain the basic refactoring with minimal distractions, so I hope you'll forgive the simplicity. (They are certainly not examples of good business object design.) I'm sure you'll be able to apply them to your rather more complex situations. Some very simple refactorings don't have examples because I didn't think an example would add much.
- In particular, remember that the examples are included only to illustrate the one refactoring under discussion. In most cases, there are still problems with the code at the end, but fixing these problems requires other refactorings. In a few cases in which refactorings often go together, I carry examples from one refactoring to another. In most cases I leave the code as it is after the single refactoring. I do this to make each refactoring self-contained, because the primary role of the catalog is as a reference.
- Don't take any of these examples as suggestions for how to design employee or order objects. These examples are there only to illustrate the refactorings, nothing more. 
***** Chapter 6. Composing Methods
- The key is the semantic distance between the method name and the method body.
  
**** [[pdf:/home/slk/Dropbox/books/Refactoring/Folwer, Martin - Refactoring (2020).pdf::1][Refactoring: Improving the Design of Existing Code; 2020]]
 - With any introductory example, however, I run into a problem. If I pick a large program, describing it and how it is refactored is too complicated for a mortal reader to work through.(...) However, if I pick a program that is small enough to be comprehensible, refactoring does not look like it is worthwhile.
 
 - Thus, if I’m faced with modifying a program with hundreds of lines of code, I’d rather it be structured into a set of functions and other program elements that allow me to understand more easily what the program is doing. If the program lacks structure, it’s usually easier for me to add structure to the program first, and then make the change I need.

 - If the code works and doesn’t ever need to change, it’s perfectly fine to leave it alone. It would be nice to improve it, but unless someone needs to understand it, it isn’t causing any real harm. Yet as soon as someone does need to understand how that code works, and struggles to follow it, then you have to do something about it.

 - Refactoring changes the programs in small steps, so if you make a mistake, it is easy to find where the bug is.
 - Any fool can write code that a computer can understand. Good programmers write code that humans can understand.
 - The true test of good code is how easy it is to change it.
 - Refactoring (noun): a change made to the internal structure of software to make it easier to understand and cheaper to modify without changing its observable behavior.
 - Refactoring (verb): to restructure software by applying a series of refactorings without changing its observable behavior.
 - Refactoring is very similar to performance optimization, as both involve carrying out code manipulations that don’t change the overall functionality of the program. The difference is the purpose: Refactoring is always done to make the code “easier to understand and cheaper to modify.” This might speed things up or slow things down. With performance optimization, I only care about speeding up the program, and am prepared to end up with code that is harder to work with if I really need that improved performance.

 - Without refactoring, the internal design—the architecture—of software tends to decay.As people change code to achieve short­term goals, often without a full comprehensionof the architecture, the code loses its structure. It becomes harder for me to see thedesign by reading the code. Loss of the structure of code has a cumulative effect. Theharder it is to see the design in the code, the harder it is for me to preserve it, and themore rapidly it decays. Regular refactoring helps keep the code in shape.

 - It reminds me of a statement Kent Beck often makes about himself: “I’m not a great programmer; I’m just a good programmer with great habits.” Refactoring helps me be much more effective at writing robust code. 

 - Branches. As I write this, a common approach in teams is for each team member to work on abranch of the code base using a version control system, and do considerable work onthat branch before integrating with a mainline (often called master or trunk) sharedacross the team. Often, this involves building a whole feature on a branch, notintegrating into the mainline until the feature is ready to be released into production.Fans of this approach claim that it keeps the mainline clear of any in­process code,provides a clear version history of feature additions, and allows features to be revertedeasily should they cause problems.There are downsides to feature branches like this. The longer I work on an isolatedbranch, the harder the job of integrating my work with mainline is going to be when I’mdone. Most people reduce this pain by frequently merging or re­basing from mainlineto my branch. But this doesn’t really solve the problem when several people areworking on individual feature branches. I distinguish between merging and integration.If I merge mainline into my code, this is a oneway movement—my branch changes butthe mainline doesn’t. I use “integrate” to mean a two­way process that pulls changesfrom mainline into my branch and then pushes the result back into mainline, changingboth. If Rachel is working on her branch I don’t see her changes until she integrateswith mainline; at that point, I have to merge her changes into my feature branch, whichmay mean considerable work. The hard part of this work is dealing with semanticchanges. Modern version control systems can do wonders with merging complexchanges to the program text, but they are blind to the semantics of the code. If I’vechanged the name of a function, my version control tool may easily integrate mychanges with Rachel’s. But if, in her branch, she added a call to a function that I’verenamed in mine, the code will fail.The problem of complicated merges gets exponentially worse as the length of featurebranches increases. Integrating branches that are four weeks old is more than twice ashard as those that are a couple of weeks old. Many people, therefore, argue for keepingfeature branches short—perhaps just a couple of days. Others, such as me, want themeven shorter than that. This is an approach called Continuous Integration (CI), alsoknown as Trunk­Based Development. With CI, each team member integrates withmainline at least once per day. This prevents any branches diverting too far from eachother and thus greatly reduces the complexity of merges. CI doesn’t come for free: Itmeans you use practices to ensure the mainline is healthy, learn to break large featuresinto smaller chunks, and use feature toggles (aka feature flags) to switch off any in­process features that can’t be broken down.Fans of CI like it partly because it reduces the complexity of merges, but the dominantreason to favor CI is that it’s far more compatible with refactoring. Refactorings ofteninvolve making lots of little changes all over the code base—which are particularlyprone to semantic merge conflicts (such as renaming a widely used function). Many ofus have seen feature­branching teams that find refactorings so exacerbate mergeproblems that they stop refactoring. CI and re­factoring work well together, which iswhy Kent Beck combined them in Extreme Programming.I’m not saying that you should never use feature branches. If they are sufficiently short,their problems are much reduced. (Indeed, users of CI usually also use branches, butintegrate them with mainline each day.) Feature branches may be the right techniquefor open source projects where you have infrequent commits from programmers whoyou don’t know well (and thus don’t trust). But in a full­time development team, thecost that feature branches impose on refactoring is excessive. Even if you don’t go to fullCI, I certainly urge you to integrate as frequently as possible. You should also considerthe objective evidence [Forsgren et al.] that teams that use CI are more effective insoftware deliver

**** [[pdf:/home/slk/Dropbox/books/Refactoring/Feathers, Michael - Working Effectively with Legacy Code (2005).pdf::1][Working Effectively with Legacy Code; 2005]]
 - To me, legacy code is simply code without tests. I’ve gotten some grief for this definition. What do tests have to do with whether code is bad? To me, the answer is straightforward, and it is a point that I elaborate throughout the book: 'Code without tests is bad code. It doesn’t matter how well written it is; it doesn’t matter how pretty or object-oriented or well-encapsulated it is. With tests, we can change the behavior of our code quickly and verifiably. Without them, we really don’t know if our code is getting better or worse.'

 - being able to confidently make changes in any code base.

 - Preserving existing behavior

 - Changes in a system can be made in two primary ways. I like to call them Edit and Pray and Cover and Modify. Unfortunately, Edit and Pray is pretty much the industry standard. When you use Edit and Pray, you carefully plan the changes you are going to make, you make sure that you understand the code you are going to modify, and then you start to make the changes. When you’re done, you run the system to see if the change was enabled, and then you poke around further to make sure that you didn’t break anything. The poking around is essential. When you make your changes, you are hoping and praying that you’ll get them right, and you take extra time when you are done to make sure that you did.

 - ...testing is a tough problem, and people are often seduced by the idea that they can test through a GUI or web interface without having to do anything special to their application. It can be done, but it is usually more work than anyone on a team is prepared to admit. In addition, a user interface often isn’t the best place to write tests. UIs are often volatile and too far from the functionality being tested. When UI-based tests fail, it can be hard to figure out why. Regardless, people  often spend considerable money trying to do all of their testing with those sorts of tools.

 Exploratory Refactoring: the recipe
 When you feel stuck because you don't understand what the code is doing, here's what you can do:
 Take a breath, there is a way out and you're about to find it
 Reset your git status to start fresh (git reset --hard or git stash will do)
 Set up a timer for 30 minutes
 Refactor the code freely, don't worry if the code still compiles, just go ahead and change it
 Throw away your changes when the timer rings!
 Just do it: git reset --hard
 Take a break, go drink some water and think about what you just learned

As a program is evolved its complexity increases unless work is done to maintain or reduce it.

Borrowing a phrase from the health care domain “a good doctor is one who knows the medicines but a great doctor is one who knows the disease”

[[https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grady_Booch#cite_note-16][Grady Booch]]

We believe that the impact of a smell can only be judged based on the design context in which it occurs.

However, today, software engineers are expected to build really complex software within a short time frame in an environment where requirements are continuously changing. Needless to say, it is a huge challenge to maintain the quality of the design and overall software in such a context.

In the midst of this struggle, it became clear to us that if we wanted to organize this collection so that we could share it in a beneficial manner with fellow architects, designers, and developers, our classification scheme should be linked to something fundamental, i.e., design principles.

**** design smells?
     Design smells are certain structures in the design that indicate violation of fundamental design principles and negatively impact design quality.
In other words, a design smell indicates a potential problem in the design structure. The medical domain provides a good analogy for our work on smells. The symptoms of a patient can be likened to a “smell,” and the underlying disease can be likened to the concrete “design problem.”
**** technical debt
Technical debt is the debt that accrues when you knowingly or unknowingly make wrong or non-optimal design decisions.  Technical debt is a metaphor coined by Ward Cunningham in a 1992 report [44]. Technical debt is analogous to financial debt. When a person takes a loan (or uses his credit card), he incurs debt. If he regularly pays the installments (or the credit card bill) then the created debt is repaid and does not create further problems.  However, if the person does not pay his installment (or bill), a penalty in the form of interest is applicable and it mounts every time he misses the payment. In case the person is not able to pay the installments (or bill) for a long time, the accrued interest can make the total debt so ominously large that the person may have to declare bankruptcy.

•	Code debt: Static analysis tool violations and inconsistent coding style.
•	Design debt: Design smells and violations of design rules.
•	Test debt: Lack of tests, inadequate test coverage, and improper test design.
•	Documentation debt: No documentation for important concerns, poor docu-
mentation, and outdated documentation.

Jim Highsmith [45] describes how Cost of Change (CoC) varies wth technical debt.

**** PHAME
     We treat the four major elements of Booch’s object model as “design principles” and refer to them collectively as PHAME (Principles of Hierarchy, Abstraction, Modularization, and Encapsulation).
**** Booch’s fundamental design principles HAME
***** hierarchy
***** abstraction
The principle of abstraction advocates the simplification of entities through reduction and generalization: reduction is by elimination of unnecessary details and generalization is by identification and specification of common and important characteristics.

****** Missing Abstraction
Clumps of data or encoded strings are used instead of creating a class or an interface

******* Rationale
- It can expose implementation details to different abstractions, violating the principle of encapsulation.
- When data and associated behavior are spread across abstractions, it can lead to tight coupling between entities, resulting in brittle and non-reusable code. Hence, not creating necessary abstractions also violates the principle of modularization.
******* Potential Causes
******** Inadequate design analysis
When careful thought is not applied during design, it is easy to overlook creating abstractions and use primitive type values or strings to “get the work done.” In our experience, this often occurs when software is developed under tight deadlines or resource constraints.
******** Lack of refactoring
As requirements change, software evolves and entities that were earlier represented using strings or primitive types may need to be refactored into classes or interfaces.  When the existing clumps of data or encoded strings are retained as they are without refactoring them, it can lead to a Missing Abstraction smell.
******** Misguided focus on minor performance gains 
This smell often results when designers compromise design quality for minor performance gains. For instance, we have observed developers using arrays directly in the code instead of creating appropriate abstractions since they feel that indexing arrays is faster than accessing members in objects. In most contexts, the performance gains due to such “optimizations” are minimal, and do not justify the resultant trade-off in design quality.
https://steemit.com/php/@crell/php-use-associative-arrays-basi
******* Examples
******** from, to
data clumps always used together
******* Refactor
create abstraction(s) that can internally make use
of primitive type values or strings.
******* Alias
******** Primitive Obsession
This smell occurs when [[*primitive elements - types][primitive types]] are used for encoding dates, currency, etc. instead of creating classes.
******** Data clumps
This smell occurs when there are clumps of data items that occur together in lots of places instead of creating a class.
****** Imperative Abstraction
This smell arises when an operation is turned into a class. This smell manifests as a class that has only one method defined within the class. At times, the class name itself may be identical to the one method defined within it. For instance, if you see class with name Read that contains only one method named read() with no data members, then the Read class has Imperative Abstraction smell. Often, it is also seen in the case of this smell that the data on which the method operates is located within a different class.  It should be noted that it is sometimes desirable to turn an operation into a class.
******* Rationale
Defining functions or procedures explicitly as classes (when the data is located somewhere else) is a glorified form of structured programing rather than object-oriented programming. One-operation classes cannot be representative of an “abstraction,” especially when the associated data is placed somewhere else. Clearly, this is a violation of the principle of abstraction. Since these classes are ‘doing’ things instead of ‘being’ things, this smell is named Imperative Abstraction.  If operations are turned into classes, the design will suffer from an explosion of one-method classes and increase the complexity of the design. Furthermore, many of these methods that act on the same data would be separated into different classes and thus reduce the cohesiveness of the design. For these reasons, this smell also violates the principles of encapsulation and modularization.
The smell not only increases the number of classes (in this case there are at least four classes when ideally one could have been used), but also increases the complex- ity involved in development and maintenance because of the unnecessary separation of cohesive methods.
******* Potential Causes
******** procedural thinking
******* Refactor
To refactor the Imperative Abstraction design smell, you have to either find or create an appropriate abstraction to house the method existing within the Imperative Abstraction. You also have to encapsulate the data needed by the method within the same abstraction to improve cohesion and reduce coupling.
******* Reification 
is the promotion or elevation of something that is not an object into an object. When we reify behavior, it is possible to store it, pass it, or transform it. Reification improves flexibility of the system at the cost of introducing some complexity [52].  Many design patterns [54] employ reification. Examples:

• State pattern: Encoding a state-machine.

• Command pattern: Encoding requests as command objects. A permitted exception for this smell is when a Command pattern has been used to objectify method requests.

• Strategy pattern: Parameterizing a procedure in terms of an operation it uses.

In other words, when we consciously design in such a way to elevate non-objects to objects for better reusability, flexibility, and extensibility (i.e., for improving
design quality), it is not a smell.

******* Aliases
“Operation class” ??? [51,52] — This smell occurs when an operation that should have been a method within a class has been turned into a class itself.
****** Incomplete Abstraction
An abstraction (entity or interface) does not support complementary or interrelated methods completely
For example, if we need to be able to add or remove elements in a data
structure, the type abstracting that data structure should support both add() and
remove() methods. Supporting only one of them makes the abstraction incomplete

| Min/max        | Open/close  | Create/destroy | Get/set   |
| Read/write     | Print/scan  | First/last     | Begin/end |
| Start/stop     | Lock/unlock | Show/hide      | Up/down   |
| First/last     | Push/pull   |                |           |
| Enable/disable | Left/right  | On/off         |           |

Sometimes, a designer may make a conscious design decision to not provide symmetric or matching methods. For example, in a read-only collection, only add() method may be provided without the corresponding remove() method. In such a case, the abstraction may appear incomplete, but is not a smell.

******* Aliases
This smell is also known in literature as:
  
• “Class supports incomplete behavior” [18]—This smell occurs when the public interface of a class is incomplete and does not support all the behavior needed by objects of that class.

• “Half-hearted operations” [63]—This smell occurs when interrelated methods provided in an incomplete or in an inconsistent way; this smell could lead to runtime problems.
****** Multifaceted Abstraction
This smell arises when an abstraction has more than one responsibility assigned to it.

In particular, the Single Responsibility Principle says that an abstraction should have a single well-defined responsibility and that responsibility should be entirely encapsulated
within that abstraction. 

Since the abstraction has multiple “faces” or “responsibilities”, it is named Multifaceted Abstraction.

Single “Responsibility” Principle does not mean logical grouping of all functionality related to a concept. Rather “responsibility” refers to a concrete, specific, and precise responsibility that has one reason to change

******* Potential Causes
******** General-purpose abstractions
An abstraction with a generic name (Node , Component, Element, and Item ), it often becomes a “placeholder” for providing all the functionality related (but not necessarily belonging) to that abstraction. Hence, general purpose abstractions often exhibit this smell.
******** Evolution without periodic refactoring
When a class undergoes extensive changes over a long period of time without refac- toring, other responsibilities start getting introduced in these classes and design decay starts. In this way, negligence toward refactoring leads to the creation of monolithic blobs that exhibit multiple responsibilities.
******** The burden of processes
Sometimes the viscosity of the software and environment serves to discourage the adoption of good practices.
******** Mixing up concerns
******* Example
Classes exhibiting Multifaceted Abstraction are usually large and complex.  For example, java.util.Calendar class (in JDK 7) spans 2825 lines of code and has 67 methods and 71 fields! However, large or complex implementation is not an essential characteristic of classes having Multifaceted Abstraction smell; see the discussion on Insufficient Modularization smell (Section 5.2).

******* Aliases
• “Divergent change” [7]—This smell occurs when a class is changed for different reasons.

• “Conceptualization abuse” [30]—This smell occurs when two or more noncohesive concepts have been packed into a single class of the system.
	 
• “Large class” [7,24,57,58]—This smell occurs when a class has “too many” responsibilities.
	 
• “Lack of cohesion” [59]—This smell occurs when there is a large type in a design with low cohesion, i.e., a “kitchen sink” type that represents many abstractions.

****** Unnecessary Abstraction
An abstraction that is not needed

ALIASES:
Irrelevant class - class does not have any meaningful behavior in the design
Lazy class / Freeloader — class does “too little”
Small class - class has no (or too few) variables or no (or too few) methods in it
Mini-class - a public, non-nested class defines less than three methods and less than three attributes (including constants) in it
No responsibility - class has no responsibility associated with it
Agent classes - class serve as an “agent” (i.e., they only pass messages from one class to another), indicating that the class may be unnecessary
****** Unutilized Abstraction
An abstraction is left unused (either not directly used or not
reachable). This smell manifests in two forms:

• Unreferenced abstractions—Concrete classes that are not being used by anyone
• Orphan abstractions—Stand-alone interfaces/abstract classes that do not have
any derived abstractions


This smell violates the principle YAGNI (You
Aren’t Gonna Need It), which recommends not adding functionality until deemed
necessary [53]

When an abstraction is left unused
in design, it does not serve a meaningful purpose in design, and hence violates the
principle of abstraction.

POTENTIAL CAUSES:
Leftover garbage during maintenance or refactoring.
Speculative generality - abstractions are introduced speculating that they may be required sometime in future.


REFACTORING:
remove the Unutilized Abstraction from the design.

IMPACT:
pollutes the design space and increases cognitive load. This impacts understandability.
UNUTILIZED ABSTRACTION
Two or more abstractions have identical names or identical implementation or both


POTENTIAL CAUSES:

Copy-paste programming
The “get-the-work-done” mindset of a programmer leads him to copy and paste code
instead of applying proper abstraction.
Ad hoc maintenance
When the software undergoes haphazard fixes or enhancements over many years, it
leaves “crufts”6 with lots of redundant code in it.
Lack of communication
Often, in industrial software, code duplication occurs because different people work
on the same code at different times in the life cycle of the software. They are not
aware of existing classes or methods and end up re-inventing the wheel.

REFACTORING:
For identical name form, the suggested refactoring is to rename one of the abstrac-
tions to a unique name.
In the case of the identical implementation form of Duplicate Abstraction, if the
implementations are exactly the same, one of the implementations can be removed.
If the implementations are slightly different, then the common implementation in
the duplicate abstractions can be factored out into a common class.


IMPACT:
it affects understandability of the design. Developers of client code will be confused and unclear about the choice
of the abstraction that should be used by their code.

identical implementation (i.e., they have duplicate code), it becomes difficult to maintain them.
In summary, this smell indicates a violation of the DRY (Don’t Repeat Yourself)
principle.
If the DRY principle is not fol-
lowed, a modification of an element within the system requires modifications to other
logically unrelated elements making maintainability a nightmare. Since there is dupli-
cation among abstractions in the design, this smell is named Duplicate Abstraction.

This smell is also known in literature as:

- Do not refer to a grouping of accounts as an accountList unless it’s actually a List. The word list means something specific to programmers.

So accountGroup or bunchOfAccounts or just plain accounts would be better.
- A truly awful example of disinformative names would be the use of lower-case L or uppercase O as variable names, especially in combination. The problem, of course, is that they look almost entirely like the constants one and zero, respectively.

** description
*** "Subjective Evaluation of Software Evolvability Using Code Smells: An Empirical Study" 2006
   - The agile community...has come up with a term called code smell (Fowler and Beck, 2000) to help software developers recognise problematic code. These code smells are general descriptions of bad code that are supposed to help software developers decide when the code needs refactoring.
   - Fowler and Beck (2000) propose a list of 22 bad code smells. Fowler and Beck introduce code smells as a more concrete indication of the need for refactoring than "some vague idea of programming aesthetics." They also claim that no set of precise metrics can be given to identify the need for refactoring.
   - Traditionally, the term software maintainability has been used to represent this quality attribute, and IEEE (IEEE, 1990) has defined software maintainability as follows: the ease with which a software system or component can be modified to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt to a changed environment.
   - We think that the term software evolution better describes what happens after the initial software deployment/release. 
** Based On Fowler
*** Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces
    Use Rename Method on any methods that do the same thing but have different signatures for what they do. Often this doesn't go far enough. In these cases the classes aren't yet doing enough. Keep using Move Method to move behavior to the classes until the protocols are the same. If you have to redundantly move code to accomplish this, you may be able to use Extract Superclass to atone.
*** Comments
**** if you need a comment to explain what a block of code does 
     Extract Method
**** if the method is already extracted but you still need a comment to explain what it does  
     Rename Method
**** if you need to state some rules about the required state of the system
     Introduce Assertion.
**** exception
     A good time to use a comment is when you don't know what to do. In addition to describing what is going on, comments can indicate areas in which you aren't sure. A comment is a good place to say why you did something. This kind of information helps future modifiers, especially forgetful ones
*** Data Class (deprecated)
    These are classes that have fields, getting and setting methods for the fields, and nothing else.  Such classes are dumb data holders and are almost certainly being manipulated in far too much detail by other classes. In early stages these classes may have public fields. If so, you should immediately apply Encapsulate Field before anyone notices. If you have collection fields, check to see whether they are properly encapsulated and apply Encapsulate Collection if they aren't. Use Remove Setting Method on any field that should not be changed.  

    Look for where these getting and setting methods are used by other classes. Try to use Move Method to move behavior into the data class. If you can't move a whole method, use Extract Method to create a method that can be moved. After a while you can start using Hide Method on the getters and setters. 
       
    Data classes are like children. They are okay as a starting point, but to participate as a grownup object, they need to take some responsibility.
*** Data Clumps
       data items together in lots of places: fields in a couple of classes, parameters in many method signatures.
Use Extract Class on the fields to turn the clumps into an object. Then turn your attention to method signatures using Introduce Parameter Object or Preserve Whole Object to slim them down. The immediate benefit is that you can shrink a lot of parameter lists and simplify method calling. Don't worry about data clumps that use only some of the fields of the new object.  As long as you are replacing two or more fields with the new object, you'll come out ahead.
*** Divergent Change
    Divergent change occurs when one class is commonly changed in different ways for different reasons. If you look at a class and say, "Well, I will have to change these three methods every time I get a new database; I have to change these four methods every time there is a new financial instrument," you likely have a situation in which two objects are better than one. That way each object is changed only as a result of one kind of change. Of course, you often discover this only after you've added a few databases or financial instruments. Any change to handle a variation should change a single class, and all the typing in the new class should express the variation. To clean this up you identify everything that changes for a particular cause and use Extract Class to put them all together.
*** Duplicated Code
    same code structure in more than one place
**** in methods of the same class 
     Extract Function and invoke the code from both places.
**** in two sibling subclasses 
     You can eliminate this duplication by using Extract Method in both classes then Pull Up Field. If the code is similar but not the same, you need to use Extract Method to separate the similar bits from the different bits. You may then find you can use Form Template Method. If the methods do the same thing with a different algorithm, you can choose the clearer of the two algorithms and use Substitute Algorithm.
**** in two unrelated classes
     Consider using Extract Class in one class and then use the new component in the other. Another possibility is that the method really belongs only in one of the classes and should be invoked by the other class or that the method belongs in a third class that should be referred to by both of the original classes.
*** Feature Envy
**** a method accesses the data of another object more than its own data
     fix: Move Method
**** a part of method accesses the data of another object more than its own data
     fix: Extract Method, Move Method
**** exceptions
     Strategy, Visitor, Self Delegation. You use these to combat the divergent change smell. The fundamental rule of thumb is to put things together that change together. Data and the behavior that references that data usually change together, but there are exceptions. When the exceptions occur, we move the behavior to keep changes in one place. Strategy and Visitor allow you to change behavior easily, because they isolate the small amount of behavior that needs to be overridden, at the cost of further indirection.
*** Inappropriate Intimacy
    Sometimes classes become far too intimate and spend too much time delving in each others'private parts.

    Overintimate classes need to be broken up as lovers were in ancient days. Use Move Method and Move Field to separate the pieces to reduce the intimacy. See whether you can arrange a Change Bidirectional Association to Unidirectional. If the classes do have common interests, use Extract Class to put the commonality in a safe place and make honest classes of them. Or use Hide Delegate to let another class act as go-between.
       
    Inheritance often can lead to overintimacy. Subclasses are always going to know more about their parents than their parents would like them to know. If it's time to leave home, apply Replace Delegation with Inheritance.

*** Incomplete Library Class
    If there are just a couple of methods that you wish the library class had, use Introduce Foreign Method. 
    If there is a whole load of extra behavior, you need Introduce Local Extension.
*** Large Class
    When a class is trying to do too much, it often shows up as too many instance variables.

    You can Extract Class to bundle a number of the variables. Choose variables to go together in the component that makes sense for each. For example, "depositAmount" and "depositCurrency"are likely to belong together in a component. More generally, common prefixes or suffixes for some subset of the variables in a class suggest the opportunity for a component. If the component makes sense as a subclass, you'll find Extract Subclass often is easier.

    Sometimes a class does not use all of its instance variables all of the time. If so, you may be able to Extract Class or Extract Subclass many times.
       
    As with a class with too many instance variables, a class with too much code is prime breeding ground for duplicated code, chaos, and death. The simplest solution...is to eliminate redundancy in the class itself. If you have five hundred-line methods with lots of code in common, you may be able to turn them into five ten-line methods with another ten two-line methods extracted from the original. As with a class with a huge wad of variables, the usual solution for a class with too much code is either to Extract Class or Extract Subclass. A useful trick is to determine how clients use the class and to use Extract Interface
*** Lazy Class
    Each class you create costs money to maintain and understand. A class that isn't doing enough to pay for itself should be eliminated. Often this might be a class that used to pay its way but has been downsized with refactoring. Or it might be a class that was added because of changes that were planned but not made. Either way, you let the class die with dignity. If you have subclasses that aren't doing enough, try to use Collapse Hierarchy. Nearly useless components should be subjected to Inline Class.
*** Long Function
       Find parts of the method that seem to go nicely together and Extract Method.
       
       If you have a method with lots of parameters and temporary variables, these elements get in the way of extracting methods. If you try to use Extract Method, you end up passing so many of the parameters and temporary variables as parameters to the extracted method that the result is scarcely more readable than the original. You can often use Replace Temp with Query to eliminate the temps. Long lists of parameters can be slimmed down with Introduce Parameter Object and Preserve Whole Object.

       If you've tried that, and you still have too many temps and parameters, it's time to get out the heavy artillery: Replace Method with Method Object.

       Conditionals and loops also give signs for extractions. Use Decompose Conditional to deal with conditional expressions. With loops, extract the loop and the code within the loop into its own method.

Alias: Long Method

*** Long Parameter List
**** one of the parameter is switch parameter
     fix: Use Replace Parameter with Method
**** more than one value from an object are passing as parameters
     fix: Preserve Whole Object
**** parameters that naturally go together
     fix: Introduce Parameter Object
**** exceptions
     when you explicitly do not want to create a dependency from the called object to the larger object. In those cases unpacking data and sending it along as parameters is reasonable, but pay attention to the pain involved. If the parameter list is too long or changes too often, you need to rethink your dependency structure.
**** others fixes
     Replace Parameter with Query, Remove Flag Argument, Combine Functions into Class
*** Message Chains
    a client asks one object for another object, which the client then asks for yet another object, which the client then asks for yet another another object, and so on.  You may see these as a long line of getThis methods, or as a sequence of temps. Navigating this way means the client is coupled to the structure of the navigation. Any change to the intermediate relationships causes the client to have to change.  
       
    The move to use here is Hide Delegate. You can do this at various points in the chain. In principle you can do this to every object in the chain, but doing this often turns every intermediate object into a middle man. Often a better alternative is to see what the resulting object is used for.  See whether you can use Extract Method to take a piece of the code that uses it and then Move Method to push it down the chain. If several clients of one of the objects in the chain want to navigate the rest of the way, add a method to do that.
*** Middle Man
    One of the prime features of objects is encapsulation—hiding internal details from the rest of the world. Encapsulation often comes with delegation. You ask a director whether she is free for a meeting; she delegates the message to her diary and gives you an answer. All well and good.  There is no need to know whether the director uses a diary, an electronic gizmo, or a secretary to keep track of her appointments.

    However, this can go too far. You look at a class's interface and find half the methods are delegating to this other class. After a while it is time to use Remove Middle Man and talk to the object that really knows what's going on. If only a few methods aren't doing much, use Inline Method to inline them into the caller. If there is additional behavior, you can use Replace Delegation with Inheritance to turn the middle man into a subclass of the real object. That allows you to extend behavior without chasing all that delegation.
*** Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies
    Parallel inheritance hierarchies is really a special case of shotgun surgery. In this case, every time you make a subclass of one class, you also have to make a subclass of another. You can recognize this smell because the prefixes of the class names in one hierarchy are the same as the prefixes in another hierarchy.

    The general strategy for eliminating the duplication is to make sure that instances of one hierarchy refer to instances of the other. If you use Move Method and Move Field, the hierarchy on the referring class disappears.
*** Primitive Obession
    [[Primitive types]] are generic, classes are more specific  
    fix: Replace Primitive with Object

**** if data value is a type code  
     fix: Replace Type Code with Class if the value does not affect behavior. 
***** If you have conditionals that depend on the type code, 
     fix: Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy.
**** group of fields that should go together 
     fix: Extract Class
**** primitives in parameter lists 
     fix: Introduce Parameter Object
**** array	
     fix: Replace Array with Object.
*** Refused Bequest
    Subclasses get to inherit the methods and data of their parents. But what if they don't want or need what they are given? They are given all these great gifts and pick just a few to play with.
       
    The traditional story is that this means the hierarchy is wrong. You need to create a new sibling class and use Push Down Method and Push Down Field to push all the unused methods to the sibling. That way the parent holds only what is common. Often you'll hear advice that all superclasses should be abstract.  

    You'll guess from our snide use of traditional that we aren't going to advise this, at least not all the time. We do subclassing to reuse a bit of behavior all the time, and we find it a perfectly good way of doing business. There is a smell, we can't deny it, but usually it isn't a strong smell. So we say that if the refused bequest is causing confusion and problems, follow the traditional advice.  However, don't feel you have to do it all the time. Nine times out of ten this smell is too faint to be worth cleaning.  

    The smell of refused bequest is much stronger if the subclass is reusing behavior but does not want to support the interface of the superclass. We don't mind refusing implementations, but refusing interface gets us on our high horses. In this case, however, don't fiddle with t
*** Shotgun Surgery
     Opposite of Divergent Change. You whiff this when every time you make a kind of change, you have to make a lot of little changes to a lot of different classes.  When the changes are all over the place, they are hard to find, and it's easy to miss an important change. In this case you want to use Move Method and Move Field to put all the changes into a single class. If no current class looks like a good candidate, create one. Often you can use Inline Class to bring a whole bunch of behavior together. You get a small dose of divergent change, but you can easily deal with that.  Divergent change is one class that suffers many kinds of changes, and shotgun surgery is one change that alters many classes. Either way you want to arrange things so that, ideally, there is a one-to-one link between common changes and classes.
*** Speculative Generality
    You get it when people say, "Oh, I think we need the ability to this kind of thing someday" and thus want all sorts of hooks and special cases to handle things that aren't required. The result often is harder to understand and maintain. If all this machinery were being used, it would be worth it. But if it isn't, it isn't. The machinery just gets in the way, so get rid of it.

    If you have abstract classes that aren't doing much, use Collapse Hierarchy. Unnecessary delegation can be removed with Inline Class. Methods with unused parameters should be subject to Remove Parameter. Methods named with odd abstract names should be brought down to earth with Rename Method.

    Speculative generality can be spotted when the only users of a method or class are test cases. If you find such a method or class, delete it and the test case that exercises it. If you have a method or class that is a helper for a test case that exercises legitimate functionality, you have to leave it in, of course.
*** Switch Statements
    One of the most obvious symptoms of object-oriented code is its comparative lack of switch (or case) statements. The problem with switch statements is essentially that of duplication. Often you find the same switch statement scattered about a program in different places. If you add a new clause to the switch, you have to find all these switch, statements and change them. The object-oriented notion of polymorphism gives you an elegant way to deal with this problem.  

    Most times you see a switch statement you should consider polymorphism. The issue is where the polymorphism should occur. Often the switch statement switches on a type code. You want the method or class that hosts the type code value. So use Extract Method to extract the switch statement and then Move Method to get it onto the class where the polymorphism is needed. At that point you have to decide whether to Replace Type Code with Subclasses or Replace Type Code with State/Strategy. When you have set up the inheritance structure, you can use Replace Conditional with Polymorphism.  

    If you only have a few cases that affect a single method, and you don't expect them to change, then polymorphism is overkill. In this case Replace Parameter with Explicit Methods is a good option. If one of your conditional cases is a null, try Introduce Null Object.
*** Temporary Field
    Sometimes you see an object in which an instance variable is set only in certain circumstances.  Such code is difficult to understand, because you expect an object to need all of its variables.  Trying to understand why a variable is there when it doesn't seem to be used can drive you nuts.  
       
    Use Extract Class to create a home for the poor orphan variables. Put all the code that concerns the variables into the component. You may also be able to eliminate conditional code by using Introduce Null Object to create an alternative component for when the variables aren't valid.

    A common case of temporary field occurs when a complicated algorithm needs several variables.  Because the implementer didn't want to pass around a huge parameter list (who does?), he put them in fields. But the fields are valid only during the algorithm; in other contexts they are just plain confusing. In this case you can use Extract Class with these variables and the methods that require them. The new object is a method object [Beck].

Widely studied object-oriented metrics (Briand et al., 1997, 1999; Chidamber and Kemerer, 1994; Harrison et al., 1998; Henderson-Sellers, 1996; Hitz and Montazeri, 1996; Lorenz and Kidd, 1994) offer a way to assess software maintainability. Although some studies report successes in measuring maintainability with metrics (Bansiya and David, 2002; Chidamber et al., 1998; Coleman et al., 1994; Li and Henry 1993; Subramanyam and Krishnan, 2003), there are people, especially in the agile community (Beck et al., 2001), who are critical to using metrics for maintainability assessment, since they feel that metrics fail to account for the breadth of issues that humans consider when evaluating code.
- Yet, software quality, as quality in general, is largely dependent on one’s point of view (Garvin 1984; Kitchenham and Pfleeger, 1996). From a developer’s viewpoint the ease of modifying and further developing the software is clearly one of the most important quality dimensions. Traditionally one would call this viewpoint to quality software maintainability.
- Cusumano and Selby (Cusumano MA, Selby RW (1995) Microsoft secrets. Free Press, USA) describe how Microsoft uses 20% of its development effort to re-develop the code base of its products. Cusumano and Yoffie (Cusumano MA, Yoffie DB (1998) Design strategy. In: Competing on internet time. Free Press, New
York, USA, pp 180–198) report how Netscape’s inability to refactor the code base hindered their software development, and how Microsoft’s redesign efforts in the Internet Explorer 3.0 project later paid off.
- The agile community...has come up with a term called code smell (Fowler and Beck, 2000) to help software developers recognise problematic code. These code smells are general descriptions of bad code that are supposed to help software developers decide when the code needs refactoring. In most cases, the goal of code refactoring is to make the software easier to understand and/or extend. Fowler and Beck (Fowler and Beck, 2000) claim that exact criteria cannot be given to determine when a software needs refactoring. In their words, when it comes to making refactoring decisions: "no set of metrics rivals informed human intuition." This opinion is in conflict with the idea that the level of software maintainability can be determined with source code or design metrics. A counterexample to Fowler and Beck is provided by Grady (Grady, 1994), who reports that in some HP divisions there were tight threshold limits that a program was not allowed to exceed, e.g., a Fortran program’s cyclomatic complexity (McCabe, 1976) should not exceed 15. This threshold was determined based on data from previous software projects.  Also, the idea of measuring software maintainability with metrics (Coleman et al., 1994, 1995) seems to be conflicting with the idea of assessing maintainability using vaguely defined qualitative criteria, such as the code smells of Fowler and Beck.
- Traditionally, the term software maintainability has been used to represent this quality attribute, and IEEE (IEEE, 1990) has defined software maintainability as follows: the ease with which a software system or component can be modified to correct faults, improve performance or other attributes, or to adapt to a changed environment.
- We think that the term software evolution better describes what happens after the initial software deployment/release...
- Fowler and Beck (2000) propose a list of 22 bad code smells. Fowler and Beck introduce code smells as a more concrete indication of the need for refactoring than "some vague idea of programming aesthetics." They also claim that no set of precise metrics can be given to identify the need for refactoring. Thus, the code smells can be seen as a compromise between precise source code metrics and totally unguided subjective evaluation. In their experience, Fowler and Beck say that when it comes to making refactoring decisions, no set of metrics rivals informed human intuition. The code smells have been developed based on Fowler’s and Beck’s industrial experience in several software projects that according to them varied from successful to nearly catastrophic. Some code smells represent two extremes of the same attribute. For example, the size of a class could be an attribute. Too much of it leads to a smell called 'Large Class’’ and too little to the 'Lazy Class’ smell. The code smells are somewhat vaguely defined.
- Structures similar to code smells are described by Brown et al. (1998), who discuss software anti-patterns. These anti-patterns describe code problems on class to architectural levels. Some of them are similar to code smells, e.g., God Class is equal to a Large Class smell and Lava Flow is a synonym for Dead Code. However, the scope of their work is quite wide as they also discuss problems in software processes, badly behaving developers, and many other areas.
- The Air Force Operation Test and Evaluation Center (AFOTEC) pamphlet (AFOTEC, 1996) provides a rich set of instructions for evaluating software maintainability.
- In this section we introduce the 23 code smells that we surveyed. Twenty-two of the code smells were introduced by Fowler and Beck (2000). Additionally, we included a code smell for dead code, i.e., code that is never executed, as we felt it was important but not included in the list by Fowler and Beck. In the rest of the paper we will use a bold font when referring to the smells, e.g., Dead Code. We chose four smells for automatic code analysis, namely Large Class, Long Method, Long Parameter List, and Duplicate Code. We selected these because we thought their operationalization would be quite straightforward, and because we had suitable tools to measure them.
- One key assumption of code smells is that there are no exact conditions, which indicate when developers should improve the software design.
**** [[https://web.archive.org/web/20200210062009/mikamantyla.eu/BadCodeSmellsTaxonomy.html][A Taxonomy for "Bad Code Smells"]]
***** The Bloaters
- Long Parameter List
- Long Method
- Large Class
- Primitive Obsession
- Data Clumps

Bloater smells represents something that has grown so large that it cannot be effectively handled.
It seems likely that these smells grow a little bit at a time. Hopefully nobody designs, e.g., Long Methods.
Primitive Obsession is actually more of a symptom that causes bloats than a bloat itself. The same holds for Data Clumps. When a Primitive Obsession exists, there are no small classes for small entities (e.g. phone numbers). Thus, the functionality is added to some other class, which increases the class and method size in the software. With Data Clumps there exists a set of primitives that always appear together (e.g. 3 integers for RGB colors). Since these data items are not encapsulated in a class this increases the sizes of methods and classes.
***** The Object-Orientation Abusers
- Switch Statements
- Temporary Field
- Refused Bequest
- Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces

When a solution does not fully exploit the possibilities of object-oriented design.
For example, a Switch Statement might be considered acceptable or even good design in procedural programming, but is something that should be avoided in object-oriented programming. The situation where switch statements or type codes are needed should be handled by creating subclasses. Refused Bequest smells lack proper inheritance design, which is one of the key elements in object-oriented programming. The Alternative Classes with Different Interfaces smell lacks a common interface for closely related classes, so it can also be considered a certain type of inheritance misuse. The Temporary Field smell means a case in which a variable is in the class scope, when it should be in method scope. This violates the information hiding principle.

***** The Change Preventers
- Divergent Change
- Shotgun Surgery
- Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies

Change Preventers are smells is that hinder changing or further developing the software. These smells violate the rule suggested by Fowler and Beck which says that classes and possible changes should have a one-to-one relationship. For example, changes to the database only affect one class, while changes to calculation formulas only affect the other class.

The Divergent Change smell means that we have a single class that needs to be modified by many different types of changes. With the Shotgun Surgery smell the situation is the opposite, we need to modify many classes when making a single change to a system (change several classes when changing database from one vendor to another)

Parallel Inheritance Hierarchies, which means a duplicated class hierarchy, was originally placed in OO-abusers. One could also place it inside of The Dispensables since there is redundant logic that should be replaced.
***** The Dispensables
- Lazy class
- Data class
- Duplicate Code
- Dead Code
- Speculative Generality

...they all represent something unnecessary that should be removed from the source code.
This group contains two types of smells (dispensable classes and dispensable code), but since they violate the same principle, we will look at them together. If a class is not doing enough it needs to be removed or its responsibility needs to be increased. This is the case with the Lazy class and the Data class smells. Code that is not used or is redundant needs to be removed. This is the case with Duplicate Code, Speculative Generality and Dead Code smells. 

***** The Couplers
- Feature Envy
- Inappropriate Intimacy
- Message Chains
- Middle Man

This group has four coupling-related smells.
One design principle that has been around for decades is low coupling (Stevens et al. 1974) . This group has 3 smells that represent high coupling. Middle Man smell on the other hand represent a problem that might be created when trying to avoid high coupling with constant delegation. Middle Man is a class that is doing too much simple delegation instead of really contributing to the application.

The Feature Envy smell means a case where one method is too interested in other classes, and the Inappropriate Intimacy smell means that two classes are coupled tightly to each other. Message Chains is a smell where class A needs data from class D. To access this data, class A needs to retrieve object C from object B (A and B have a direct reference). When class A gets object C it then asks C to get object D. When class A finally has a reference to class D, A asks D for the data it needs. The problem here is that A becomes unnecessarily coupled to classes B, C, and D, when it only needs some piece of data from class D. The following example illustrates the message chain smell: A.getB().getC().getD().getTheNeededData()

Of course, I could make an argument that these smells should belong to the Object-Orientation abusers group, but since they all focus strictly on coupling, I think it makes the taxonomy more understandable if they are introduced in a group of their own.

***** The Others 
- Comments and Incomplete
- Library Class

Other smells that were studied, but could not be included in any of the groups are Comments and Incomplete Library Class. The Comments smell indicates the misuse of comments, i.e., when a programmer uses comments to explain some piece of code instead of writing code that is simpler and more self-explaining. Incomplete Library Class means that the application is using a third party library code that is not completely adequate for the application. According to Fowler and Beck this smell can be removed, for example, by introducing a local extension.

** Characterization Test
   Test that characterizes the actual behavior of a piece of code. It acts as a change detector, protecting legacy code from unintended changes.
** Polymorphism
describes a pattern in object oriented programming in which classes have different functionality while sharing a common interface
** Parameter vs. Argument
A parameter is the variable which is part of the function’s signature (function declaration). An argument is an expression used when calling the method.

Consider the following code:
#+begin_src php
void Foo(int i, float f)
{
    // Do things
}

void Bar()
{
    int anInt = 1;
    Foo(anInt, 2.0);
}
#+end_src

Here i and f are the parameters, and anInt and 2.0 are the arguments.

** Principle vs. Practices
   - The Boy scout motto – “Be prepared”–is a timeless principle. “Buy a plunger before you need a plunger” is a practice that applies this principle in a memorable way.
   - Principles are good ideas or good values stated in a context-independent manner. Practices are applications of theses principles stated in a context-dependent way.
   - Principle: a fundamental, primary or general law or truth
   - Practice: the action or process of performing or doing something
** Logical operators  
They are used for different purposes and in fact have different operator precedences. The && and || operators are intended for Boolean conditions, whereas and and or are intended for control flow.

For example, the following is a Boolean condition:

if ($foo == $bar && $baz != $quxx) {

This differs from control flow:

doSomething() or die();
** Value Object
- measures, quantifies or describe a thing in the domain
- identity is based on composition of values
- immutable
- compared using all values
- no side effects
- value object should never be mocked
- Value objects are powerful yet simple things. The problem that we were trying to solve earlier was that we need to constantly revalidate all of our properties. We do this because at every step, we don't know whether we can trust the object's properties to be valid. What if we could? In order to trust the values, we need two characteristics: for them to be validated and a guarantee that they haven't been changed since the validation.

Here are some reasons why unused code should be removed:

- For anyone new working on a project, they not only have to understand the working code, they have to understand unused material also. This is wasted time and creates confusion.

- There is a danger that at sometime someone will make a change which inadvertently involve the 'dormant' code and can introduce bugs. I know it's happened on projects I've worked on.

- The maintenance of any code is an administrative burden. By preserving old redundant code that burden is increased. For example, merging changes in the main branch becomes harder because there is more code to work through and more possibility to make a mistake.

- What happens over time is that more and more old unused code is added to the codebase. This increases the confusion, potential misunderstanding and administrative overhead.

- The chances that the unused code will ever be used again is very unlikely. With time that possibility of re-use diminishes. If code is to be removed and is considered important enough then the code can be branched off and documented.

- Any personal feelings that a coder may have about code they may have worked hard on are understandable. But part of being professional requires that those thoughts have to be put to one side for the better good. Time stands for no-one and there is no place for preserving historical code in a working codebase.

** query parameters
   are a defined set of parameters attached to the end of a url. They are extensions of the URL that are used to help define specific content or actions based on the data being passed. To append query params to the end of a URL, a ‘?’ Is added followed immediately by a query parameter.

   To add multiple parameters, an ‘&’ is added in between each. These can be created by any variation of object types or lengths such as String, Arrays and Numbers. The following is an example:

- keep things together that are related.
- Cohesion means sticking together. If your group of friends heads to the lunchroom as a team and sits all together, you're demonstrating strong cohesion. Cohesion is a word that comes to us through physics, where cohesion describes particles that are the same and tend to stick together — water molecules, for example. Outside of physics, cohesion describes unity among parts, and is something to be sought after. A team that has good cohesion is often a team that wins.

** formatting
   Vertical Distance
   vertical separation - or in other words - big distance between definition of variables and their usage. Variables, but also functions and methods should be defined as close as possible to the place where they are used to make it easier to read the code. Big vertical distance in definition of local variables and its usage might be a sign of function that is too big and should broken up into smaller ones.

#+END_SRC

Most of the time the alternative (endif) syntax is used in view scripts. It's often hard to see/notice the end of an if statement since a curly brace only takes up one character, when you're at the bottom of a file, it's hard to tell if it's the end of an if or a foreach. For example:

#+BEGIN_SRC php
<?php if ($condition): ?>

    <div>a huge block of html</div>

<?php endif; ?>
#+END_SRC


https://www.mediawiki.org/wiki/Manual:Coding_conventions/PHP
And the latter has poorer performance.

} else {
	echo 'Eh?';
}

// Is actually equivalent to:
if ( $foo == 'bar' ) {
	echo 'Hello world';
} else {
	if ( $foo == 'Bar' ) {

   Comments should not describe what code does (at the same level of abstraction as the code itself), but only why it does something

   Don't take this too literally, this is a guideline, if you write a short summary what a longer piece of code will do, that may be acceptable. However, comments describing obvious things like "this is an iteration" should be avoided, they don't make the code better readable or understandable, add only clutter, and they violate the DRY pinciple.
** Eliminate or Reduce Number of Parameters
   Functions should have a small number of arguments. No argument is best, followed by one, two, and three. More than three is very questionable and should be avoided with prejudice.

** Sprout Class
** Sprout Method
   When adding new functionality, write the code in a new method with TDD and then call this method from the old code. So even if you can’t test the code where your method is being called, at least the new code has tests.
1. Identify where you need to make your code change.
2. If the change can be formulated as a single sequence of statements in one place in a method, write down a call for a new method that will do the work involved and then comment it out. (I like to do this before I even write the method so that I can get a sense of what the method call will look like in context.) 
3. Determine what local variables you need from the source method, and make them arguments to the call. 
4.Determine whether the sprouted method will need to return values to source method. If so, change the call so that its return value is assigned to a variable. 
5. Develop the sprout method using test-driven development. 
6. Remove the comment in the source method to enable the call.
** Use parentheses
   Parentheses help clarify the order of operators...etc. PHP won’t get confused if you don’t use parentheses because it knows the order of operators table very well. However, a person looking at your program has to figure out which is done first, and parentheses help group operations together.
#+BEGIN_SRC php

#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_SRC php
if ((age < 20) || ((sales < 1200) && (hrsWorked > 15))) {}
#+END_SRC
** Wrap Class
   Choosing to use Wrap Class is a whole other issue. There is a higher thresh- old for this pattern. Generally two cases tip me toward using Wrap Class: 1. The behavior that I want to add is completely independent, and I don’t want to pollute the existing class with behavior that is low level or unre- lated. 2. The class has grown so large that I really can’t stand to make it worse. In a case like this, I wrap just to put a stake in the ground and provide a roadmap for later changes.
** Wrap Method
** naming
*** variable
    For boolean variable names use a "question", e.g. isReady or hasName.
    For variables or methods?
*** controllers
    singular name - ArticleController, UserController
*** method
   - isX() or hasX() for bool return type
*** snake_case
    Based on an eye tracking study on camelCase and snake_case (PDF) from 2010, snake_case is 20% easier to read than camelCase!

    | name             | psr                                       | commnnity   | description |
    |------------------+-------------------------------------------+-------------+-------------|
    | method names     | camelCase() 21/22. lower_under 1/22       | camelCase() |             |
    | properties names | $StudlyCaps or $camelCase or $under_score | $camelCase  |             |

    XMLHttpRequest is still a great tragedy

    Based on an [[http://www.cs.kent.edu/~jmaletic/papers/ICPC2010-CamelCaseUnderScoreClouds.pdf][(PDF)]] from 2010, snake_case is 20% easier to read than camelCase!

**** clients must use API with snake_case (keys in JSON object sent in request body are in snake_case).
**** database column names are also snake_case.
**** tests
      There is a fundamental difference between the two environments: in src methods name are composed solely of a verb and a noun because a method shall have a single responsability and a simple way of acting; in tests for most of the edge cases we wrote entire phrases explaining what the test code can't explain well or quickly.
** instanceof

class MyClass
{
}

$a = new MyClass;
echo (!($a instanceof stdClass));
echo (!$a instanceof stdClass); // not
#+end_src

* principles
** SOLID
  There is a strong relationship beetween each of those principles. If you take each of those principles in isolation and try to apply them in your codebase you will get limited benefit out of that. it's only when you take enterly package apply it in it entarity. Applying it all at once. Strong sinergy efect.
*** SOLID
**** Single Responsibilty (SRP)
     A class should have only one reason to change - doing one thing, and do it well.
 The object should be able to do the job completely. 
 The class has only one well-defined responsibility which is exclusively handling user data. 
 No more, no less.
 Keep only related things together.
**** Open/Closed Principle (OCP)
Software entities (classes, modules, functions, etc.) should be open for extension, but closed for modification.
Interface is open for extension but closed for modification.
Imagine the future changes you will most likely need to make...then design the class to allow these changes without needing to modify the class itself.
Common pattern: injecting an array of services insted of hardcoding all the logic right inside the class.
Strategy Pattern - inject only one service, Template Method Pattern
Increase code complexity!
**** Liskov Substitution (LSP)
     Metody do klas bazowych, muszą być w stanie używać również obiektów klas dziedziczących po klasach bazowych. Program to an, interface, not an implementation.
Class should behave like its parent class or interface.
**** Interface Segregation (ISP)
     A client should never be forced to implement an interface that it doesn't use or clients shouldn't be forced to depend on methods they do not use.
     If a class has a large interface (a lot of methods) and you often inject the class and only use some of these methods, consider splitting your class into smaller pieces.
**** Dependency Inversion (DIP).
     Prefer type-hinting interfaces and allow each interface to be designed for the high level class that will use it.

*** Separation of Concerns (SoC)
    The no.1 - the most important
    Regardless of your favorite templating strategy, it’s good practice not to mix domain logic with views. In a properly designed application it should be relatively easy to swap out one templating engine for another.

**** The Model 
Captures and centralizes all the domain model behaviour. This layer manages all the data, logic and business rules independently of the data representation. It can be said that the Model layer is the heart and soul of every MVC application.
**** The Controller 
Orchestrates interactions between the other layers. Triggers actions on the model in order to update its state and refreshes the representations associated to the model. Additionally, the Controller can also send messages to the View layer in order to change the specific Model representation.
**** The View
     A layer whose main purpose is to expose the differing representations of the Model layer and to give a way to trigger changes on the Model’s state.

Pluralization of resource names in REST URIs is the widely adopted standard followed by the overwhelming majority of public and private APIs.

| POST   | /resources     |            |         201 |              | creates one or many resource items                                |
| PUT    | /resources     |            |             |              | updates one or many resource items                                |

***** [[https://tools.ietf.org/id/draft-ietf-httpbis-semantics-01.txt][HTTP Semantics]]

****** DELETE
If a DELETE method is successfully applied, the origin server SHOULD send a 202 (Accepted) status code if the action will likely succeed but has not yet been enacted, a 204 (No Content) status code if the action has been enacted and no further information is to be supplied, or a 200 (OK) status code if the action has been enacted and the response message includes a representation describing the status.
****** PATCH
???
***** Sorting
      We can also add a sort parameter to sort by field. The sort field in turn contains a list of
      comma separated columns to sort on; the first in the list is the highest sort priority. In order
      to negatively sort you prefix a column with a negative sign -
      GET /tickets?sort=-amount: sort orders by descending order of amount
      (highest first).
      GET /tickets?sort=-amount,created_at: sort orders by descending order
      of amount (highest first). Within those amounts (with orders of equal amounts),
      older orders are listed first.

***** Searching
      We can then search using a simple parameter that applies a search query that can then be
      routed through a search service (for example, ElasticSearch).
      Suppose we want to search orders for the phrase refund, we can define a field for search
      queries:
      GET /orders?q=refund
***** Limiting fields
      Additionally, using a fields parameter we can query for specific fields:
      GET /orders?fields=amount,created_at,customer_name,shipping_address
**** How to pack data
https://jsonapi.org/format/


A JSON object MUST be at the root of every JSON:API request and response containing data. This object defines a document’s “top level”.

A document MUST contain at least one of the following top-level members:

data: the document’s “primary data”
errors: an array of error objects
meta: a meta object that contains non-standard meta-information.

The members data and errors MUST NOT coexist in the same document.

**** Factory

**** Dependency Injection
A class receives its dependencies from external sources rather than creating them itself. It's a method of decoupling code & following the Dependency Inversion principle.
***** Types of injection:
****** Construction injection: 
       dependencies are injected when creating the object. It can be used for required and optional dependencies.
****** Setter injection: 
       dependencies are injected through setters, and they are always optional.
****** Property injection: 
       dependencies are injected directly through public properties. This type of injection is not recommended as there is no control at all of what is being injected.

****** Dependency Injection Principles, Practices, and Patterns Mark Seemann, Steven van Deursen
*** Structural
    They act as interconnectors between entities. It serves as a blueprint for how basic classes can be combined to form bigger  entities. Structural patterns describe the static architecture of a design;

**** Bridge
  The Bridge pattern can be quite straightforward; it effectively allows us to decouple an abstraction from an implementation so the two can vary independently.

**** Facade
- A Facade is meant to decouple a client and a sub-system by embedding many (but sometimes just one) interface, and of course to reduce complexity.
- That’s why a good facade has no new in it. If there are multiple creations for each method, it is not a Facade, it’s a Builder or a [Abstract|Static|Simple] Factory [Method].
- The best facade has no new and a constructor with interface-type-hinted parameters. If you need creation of new instances, use a Factory as argument.
- A Facade design pattern works providing a single class that in itself instantiates other classes and provides a simple interface to use those functions. A warning when using such pattern is that, as classes are instantiated within the Facade, you are essentially tightly coupling the classes that it utilizes. There are cases where you want this, but there are cases where you do not. Where do you do not want this behavior, you are better suited to using dependency injection. I have found this to be useful when wrapping a set of poor APIs into a single unified API. It reduces external dependencies, allowing complexity to be internalized; this process can make your code more readable. In other situations, where the various classes were loosely coupled together, we may find it better to use dependency injection. By injecting objects that perform various actions into the ToyFactory class we can benefit from making testing easier by being able to inject fake classes that the ToyFactory class can manipulate. Personally, I am a huge believer in making code as easily testable as possible; hence why I don't like this approach.

**** Composite
To treat a group of objects the same way as a single instance of the object.


Composite Imagine an audio system consisting of individual songs and also playlists of songs. Yes, playlists consist of songs, but we want both to be treated individually. Both are types of music, both can be played. The Composite design pattern can help here; it allows us to ignore the differences between compositions of objects and individual objects. It allows us to treat both with identical or nearly-identical code. Let's put together a little example; a song is our example of a leaf, with playlists being composites. Music is our abstraction of playlists and songs; therefore, we can call this our component. The client of all this is our index.php file. By not discriminating between leaf-nodes and branches, our code becomes less complex and therefore less error prone.

** Architectural patterns
   This is not strictly a design pattern (but the Gang of Four didn't cover Architectural patterns
in their book); but it is incredibly relevant for PHP developers due to the web-oriented
nature of PHP. Architectural patterns address various different constraints in computer
systems through addressing performance limitations, high availability, and also
minimization of business risk.
Most developers will be familiar with the Model-View-Controller architecture when it
comes to web frameworks, more recently other architectures have started to emerge; for
example, a microservices architecture works by a set of RESTful APIs that are independent
and interconnected. Some people believe microservices move problems from the software
development layer to the systems architecture layer. The opposite of microservices often
referred to as a monolithic architecture, is where all the code is together in one application.
*** Active Record

pros: you don’t have to specify the properties of the object and how they relate to the database. The model is able to determine the properties automatically by looking at the schema of the database.
*** Repository

*** Data Transfer Object DTO
"a class with public variables and no functions" clean code p. 100. 
But in PHP we still can't declare type of variable, just type-hint parameters of methods. Like setters, so we can do it indirectly. Another great benefit it the standard rule is to not have public properties so we can stay consisten with this one. But more of great adventage of if we can make our DTO object immutable. So create only getters, without setters. Add all in constructor.

*** MVC
    What MVC means in practice is that you characterize parts of your code as either M, V, or C, and then you always know where to put it.
**** Controllers
- are what the user interacts with
- they receive a request from the user, decide what to do, and send request back
- it's the only component that interacts with the models
**** Models
- classes that are designed to work with information in your database
- are where an anpplication's data are stored
- responsible for storing and retrieving data
- know nothing about the user interface
**** Views
- are what the user sees on the screen
- they present the data to the user
- kno nothing about the models
**** Why use MVC?
- business logic separate from presentation: Separation Of Concerns
- developer specialisation
  - designers can focus on the front end without worrying about the business logic
  - developers of the models can focus on the business logic or back end without worrying about the look and feel
**** Front controller
- provide a central entry point for all request. All request are sent through one page 
**** Action suffix

***** _call is exectued for a non-existent or non-public method call
***** Stack
      No it wasn't just a naming convention. It was used to execute some code before or after every controller 'action' method. Like checking is user has logged in. 
   It is based on magic __call function which is executed for a non-existent or non-public method call.

*** MVVM
    Magento was here.
** Antipatterns
*** God objects
 Essentially, a God object is an object with either too many methods or too many properties;
 essentially, it's a class that knows too much or does too much. The God object soon becomes
 tightly coupled to (referenced by) lots of other bits of code in the application.
 So what's actually wrong with this? Well, in short, when you have one bit of code tied into
 every single other bit of code, you quickly find a maintenance disaster. If you adjust the
 logic for a method in a God object for one use case, you might find it having unintended
 consequences for another element.

 The flip side to God objects being an anti-pattern is when developing embedded systems.
 Embedded systems are used to process data on anything from a calculator to LED signage;
 they are small chips that are essentially self-contained computers and quite low cost. In this
 use case, with restricted computational power you can often find that programming
 elegance and maintainability become peripheral concerns. Slight performance increase and
 centralization of control can be more important, meaning using God objects can be
 somewhat sensible. Fortunately, PHP is incredibly seldom used to program embedded
 systems, so you are incredibly unlikely to find yourself in this particular situation.

 Another anti-pattern, called Fear of Adding Classes,
*** Singleton
 <?php
 class{
 Singleton
 private static $instance;
 public static function getInstance()
 {
 if (null === static::$instance) {
 static::$instance = new static();
 }
 }
 return static::$instance;
 protected function __construct()
 {
 }
 private function __clone()
 {
 }
 private function __wakeup()
 {
 }
 }

 So here are the reasons why this should be avoided:
 - They are inherently tightly coupled meaning they are difficult to test, for example
 using unit tests. They even maintain their state throughout the life cycle of the
 application.
 - They violate the Single Responsibility Principle by controlling their own creation
 and life cycle.
 - Fundamentally, it results in you hiding the dependencies of your application in a
 global instance. You can no longer effectively follow your dependencies around
 your code as you can't follow where they are injected as function arguments.
 They make it ineffective to find the dependency chain should you need to
 analyze it.


  Objects should typically be self-contained; they should
 only know problems about themselves and also should only solve one set of problems, its
 own problems. Anything that isn't relevant to this aim doesn't belong in that class.

*** Database as IPC
https://blog.engineyard.com/5-subtle-ways-youre-using-mysql-as-a-queue-and-why-itll-bite-you
 Let me clear this up for you; your database isn't a message queuing system. You don't use it
 schedule jobs or queue up tasks to be completed. If you need something to do that, use a
 queuing system. Your database is for data...the clue is in the name; don't shove temporary
 messages in there.
 There are many reasons why this is a bad idea. One major issue is the fact that in databases
 there is no real way to not enforce a policy by which you can guarantee that a double-read
 will not occur, and that is by utilizing row locks. This in turn, results in processes (either
 incoming out outgoing) being blocked, which in turn results in processing only being able
 to be done in a serial fashion.
 Furthermore, in order to check if there is any work to do you end up essentially counting
 the rows of data in the database to see if there is work to do; you run this on a continuous
 basis. MySQL doesn't support push notifications; unlike PostgreSQL it doesn't have the
 NOTIFY command to pair with a LISTEN channel.
 Also note that when you merge a job queue with a database table that stores real data, you
 also invalidate the cache every time you complete a job and update a flag, in turn making
 MySQL far slower.
 In short, it results in your database performing worse and can force it to slow critical
 messages to a standstill. You must be careful not to turn your database into a job queue by
 having this functionality sneak up on you; instead, use the database exclusively for data,
 and bear this in mind when extending your database.
 RabbitMQ provides an open source queuing system with some great PHP SDKs.

 Interface Bloat
 Interfaces shouldn't contain thousands of methods that reference internal operations of the
 class. They should be lightweight and considered a way of guaranteeing that when
 something is queried that it is definitely there.

 Interfaces should be used sparingly; do you actually need an interface if the class is only
 ever going to be implemented once and once alone (and realistically, no one is never going
 to need to tamper with such code?). If so, you might want to consider avoiding an interface
 in such a situation.

 So, let me draw you to one implementation of Interface Bloat. Let's take a look at the
 Pheanstalk interface class in the Pheanstalk open source library (note I have stripped the
 comments to make it more readable):
 <?php
 namespace Pheanstalk;
 interface PheanstalkInterface
 {
 const DEFAULT_PORT = 11300;
 const DEFAULT_DELAY = 0;
 const DEFAULT_PRIORITY = 1024;
 const DEFAULT_TTR = 60;
 const DEFAULT_TUBE = 'default';
 public function setConnection(Connection $connection);
 public function getConnection();
 public function bury($job, $priority = self::DEFAULT_PRIORITY);
 public function delete($job);
 [ 49 ]
 Anti-Patterns
 public function ignore($tube);
 public function kick($max);
 public function kickJob($job);
 public function listTubes();
 public function listTubesWatched($askServer = false);
 public function listTubeUsed($askServer = false);
 public function pauseTube($tube, $delay);
 public function resumeTube($tube);
 public function peek($jobId);
 public function peekReady($tube = null);
 public function peekDelayed($tube = null);
 public function peekBuried($tube = null);
 public function put($data, $priority = self::DEFAULT_PRIORITY, $delay =
 self::DEFAULT_DELAY, $ttr = self::DEFAULT_TTR);
 public function putInTube($tube, $data, $priority =
 self::DEFAULT_PRIORITY, $delay = self::DEFAULT_DELAY, $ttr =
 self::DEFAULT_TTR);
 public function release($job, $priority = self::DEFAULT_PRIORITY,
 $delay = self::DEFAULT_DELAY);
 public function reserve($timeout = null);
 public function reserveFromTube($tube, $timeout = null);
 public function statsJob($job);
 public function statsTube($tube);
 public function stats();
 public function touch($job);
 public function useTube($tube);
 public function watch($tube);
 public function watchOnly($tube);
 }
 Yuck! Notice how even constants have been put in the implement, the one thing you might
 actually want to change. Clearly, this is an interface for a class that can only be
 implemented one way, making the Interface useless.


 Bloated optimization
 Often, developers may trip over themselves trying to optimize their code or their design
 artifacts to a ridiculous extent, often before their code even performs basic functions, or
 even before any code has been created at all. This can rapidly perform issues in production.
 In this section, I wish to discuss three anti-patterns specifically relating to this topic:
 Analysis paralysis
 Bikeshedding
 Premature optimization
 [ 62 ]
 Anti-Patterns
 Analysis paralysis
 In short, this is where a strategy is over-analyzed to the point where progress is slowed
 down, or even stopped entirely in extreme cases. Not only can such solutions become
 obsolete rapidly, they can be made in under-educated circumstances, for example, in a
 meeting where an over-analytic boss tries to dig too deep into detail in advance without
 allowing their developers to actually do some research.
 Over-analyzing a problem and seeking a perfect solution upfront just does not work;
 programmers should seek to refine their solution, not come up with the refined solution up
 front.
 Bikeshedding
 Essentially, this is where analysis paralysis can occur on the basis of some very trivial
 decisions, for example, the color of a log in page. The only fix that's required is to not waste
 time on trivial decisions. Avoid design by committee where possible as the majority of
 people, regardless of how good they think their design skills are, are largely incompetent at
 design.
 Premature optimization
 In this section, so far, I've largely beaten up project managers; no time to beat up
 developers. Often, developers will seek to optimize their code prematurely without having
 educated data-led conclusions to drive where and when optimizations should be made.
 Writing clean and readable code is your first priority; then you can use some great profiling
 tools to determine where your bottlenecks are. XDebug and New Relic are just some of the
 tools that are good at this.
 That said, there are some cases where optimization must be done, particularly on some long
 computational tasks where it can be mission-critical to reduce something from O(N2) time
 to O(N). This said, most simple PHP web apps will have no real need to use this
 consideration.
*** Is storing types in the database an anti pattern?
You're then binding the type name to outside data, limiting your refactoring capabilities and making people change stuff in two places when they make a new class.
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/336958/how-bad-is-it-to-store-class-and-assembly-names-in-the-database
My hesitation over doing this is that I think it introduces a higher degree of coupling between the layers.

** Notes 
There are numerous benefits to writing unit tests; they help with regression, provide documentation, and facilitate good design. 

Two Approach
Test First 
Test After

Test doubles are tools you can use when you need to create substitute dependencies]

Legacy codebases are not ready for isolated unit tests.

ARRANGE-ACT-ASSERT
a pattern for arranging and formatting code in UnitTest methods:
Each method should group these functional sections, separated by blank lines:
Arrange all necessary preconditions and inputs.
Act on the object or method under test.
Assert that the expected results have occurred.

'bit by bit you rewrite your code to be testable'

A double is a substitue for a real dependency

Assertions base test - most framework

dummies, spies, stubs, mocks, fakes

dummies - a stand-in for a dependency when class signatures or functionality don't matter, like PHP stdObject - but fail on type hints :/
stubs - substitue for a dependency and it matches the class signature, use stubs if you use type hints
mocks - a stub that uses the framework tools - most common

fakes - dependency built without the use of framework tools

feedback loop

'your decision to not build systems to catch mistakes will cost you more money

Chris???

https://github.com/opencfp/opencfp

Dependencies that you are unable to set at runtime can cause a problem ->

What to test ?
Critical Functionality - First the most valuable parts - like register form if it ncessary.
Bug Fixes - Every Bug that was found.
New Features - New Functionality

https://github.com/kahlan/kahlan

- use real dependencies when you can
- when you can't use real dependencies, try test doubles
- if you have significant amounts of code that would be burdensome to refactor, consider monkey patching
- keep doubles in sync with real dependencies


Manual or Automate Testing

-avoid regressions

Permutations != Execution Paths - you only nee to write a test case for each execution path, not for each permutation.
The number of possible paths grows with each new decision branch.

https://www.brandonsavage.net/dont-write-useless-unit-tests/

http://www.ifdattic.com/mock-test-double-using-prophecy/

http://stakeholderwhisperer.com/posts/2015/1/economy-of-tests

First, create the test.
Second, write the minimum amount of code to get that test to pass.
And third, now that your tests are passing, you can safely refactor your code to make it fancier.

Test. Code. Refactor.

You should write the tests first and then write your code.

unit - test one specific method on a class. Fake any needed database connections. One class in complete isolation.

integration - just like a unit test. Except it uses the real database connection.

functional - write a test to command a browser. Browser surfs your site, clicks links, fills out forms & asserts things is sees on the page. Testing the interface that users actually use!


Mock services. But don't mock simple model objects.

Let me say it a different way: if you're organizing your code well, then all classes will fall into one of two types. The first type - a model class - is a class whose job is basically to hold data... but not do much work. Our entities are model classes. The second type - a service class - is a class whose main job is to do work, but it doesn't hold much data, other than maybe some configuration. DinosaurFactory is a service class.

As a rule, you will want to mock service classes, but you do not need to mock model classes. Why not? Well, you can... but usually it's overkill. Since model classes tend to be simple and just hold data, it's easy enough to create those objects and set their data to whatever you want.

https://github.com/beberlei/assert

You need tests; yes, automated tests can be slow to write, but they are crucial for ensuring
things don't break when you rewrite or refactor them.

** Why?
*** Less coupled code
    When code is tightly coupled, it can be difficult to unit test. Without creating unit tests for the code that you're writing, coupling may be less apparent.
Writing tests for your code will naturally decouple your code, because it would be more difficult to test otherwise.

**** MethodName_StateUnderTest_ExpectedBehavior
***** MethodName - method name that being tested
***** StateUnderTest - input value
***** ExpectedBehaviour - what methods returns for specified input
**** Feature to be tested: Many suggests that it is better to simply write the feature to be tested because one is anyway using annotations to identify method as test methods. It is also recommended for the reason that it makes unit tests as alternate form of documentation and avoid code smells. Following is how tests in first example would read like if named using this technique:
***** IsNotAnAdultIfAgeLessThan18
***** FailToWithdrawMoneyIfAccountIsInvalid
***** StudentIsNotAdmittedIfMandatoryFieldsAreMissing
*** Types of Test Doubles:
**** Dummy 
Used only as a placeholder when an argument needs to be filled in.
**** Stub 
Provides fake data to the System Under Test
**** Spy
Records information about how it is used, and can provide that information back to the test.
**** Mock
Defines an expectation on how it will be used, and with what parameters. Will cause a test to fail automatically if the expectation isn’t met.
**** Fake
An actual implementation of the contract, but is unsuitable for production.

***** must be an instance of Doctrine\Common\Collections\ArrayCollection, instance of Doctrine\ORM\PersistentCollection returned
	      So why is this? Well if we look deeper in the Doctrine classes we can find the following:

	    ArrayCollection is a class that implements the interface Collection:
	    class ArrayCollection implements Collection, Selectable
	    PersistentCollection is class that extends AbstractLazyCollection:
	    final class PersistentCollection extends AbstractLazyCollection implements Selectable
	    but AbstractLazyCollection implements Collection:
	    abstract class AbstractLazyCollection implements Collection

	    Collection is an interface and we should use that instead. Use your interfaces and not your implementations! Now it does not matter if the actual result is an ArrayCollection or a PersistentCollection. They are all implementations of the interface. In our entities we work with an array collection but Doctrine uses a persistent collection to lazy load our properties only when required. This is a mechanic of doctrine to improve performance and memory usage.
***** unique
      @UniqueConstraint and unique=true are part of Doctrine and do similar thing.

      When you set unique=true on a particular column, then Doctrine will create a unique key on this column physically in database.

      @UniqueConstraint can be used to create a unique key in database on multiple columns (complex unique key). But if you pass a single column, then the result will be exactly the same as using unique=true on that field.

      @UniqueEntity on the other hand is not a part of Doctrine, but it's a part of Symfony framework. While options above are used by Doctrine to generate proper schema, this one is just a validator used usually by Symfony Form Component at time of submitting the form.

      So to answer your final question - yes, you usually should use both @UniqueEntity and one of @UniqueConstraint or unique=true.

* database
** refactorings
*** Add CRUD Methods 
    Introduce stored procedures (methods) to implement the creation,
    retrieval, update, and deletion (CRUD) of the data representing a business entity.
*** Add Foreign Key Constraint
    Add a foreign key constraint to an existing table to enforce
    a relationship to another table.
*** Add Lookup Table
    Create a lookup table for an existing column.
*** Add Mirror Table
    Create a mirror table, an exact duplicate of an existing table in one
    database, in another database.
*** Add Parameter
    Existing method needs information that was not passed in before.
*** Add Read Method 
    Introduce a methodin this case, a stored procedureto implement the
    retrieval of the data representing zero or more business entities from the database.
*** Add Trigger For Calculated Column 
    Introduce a new trigger to update the value
    contained in a calculated column.
*** Apply Standard Codes 
    Apply a standard set of code values to a single column to ensure
    that it conforms to the values of similar columns stored elsewhere in the database.
*** Apply Standard Type
    Ensure that the data type of a column is consistent with the data
    type of other similar columns within the database.
*** Consolidate Conditional Expression 
    Combine sequence of conditional tests into a
    single conditional expression and extract it.
*** Consolidate Key Strategy 
    Choose a single key strategy for an entity and apply it
    consistently throughout your database.
*** Decompose Conditional
    Extract methods from the condition.
*** Drop Column 
    Remove a column from an existing table.
*** Drop Column Constraint 
    Remove a column constraint from an existing table.
*** Drop Default Value 
    Remove the default value that is provided by a database from an
    existing table column.
*** Drop Foreign Key Constraint 
    Remove a foreign key constraint from an existing table so
    that a relationship to another table is no longer enforced by the database.
*** Drop Non-Nullable 
    Change an existing non-nullable column so that it accepts null
    values.
*** Drop Table 
    Remove an existing table from the database.
*** Drop View 
    Remove an existing view.
*** Encapsulate Table With View 
    Wrap access to an existing table with a view.
*** Extract Method 
    Turn the code fragment into a method whose name explains the
    purpose of the method.Insert Data (page 296): Insert data into an existing table.
*** Introduce Calculated Column 
    Introduce a new column based on calculations involving
    data in one or more tables.
*** Introduce Calculation Method
    Introduce a new method, typically a stored function,
    which implements a calculation that uses data stored within the database.
*** Introduce Cascading Delete
    Ensure that the database automatically deletes the
    appropriate "child records" when a "parent record" is deleted.
*** Introduce Column Constraint
    Introduce a column constraint in an existing table.
*** Introduce Common Format
    Apply a consistent format to all the data values in an
    existing table column.
*** Introduce Default Value 
    Let the database provide a default value for an existing table
    column.
*** Introduce Hard Delete 
    Remove an existing column which indicates that a row has been
    deleted and instead actually delete the row.
*** Introduce Index 
    Introduce a new index of either unique or non-unique type.
*** Introduce New Column 
    Introduce a new column in an existing table.
*** Introduce New Table 
    Introduce a new table in an existing database.
*** Introduce Read-Only Table 
    Create a read-only data store based on existing tables in
    the database.
*** Introduce Soft Delete
    Introduce a flag to an existing table which indicates that a row
    has been deleted instead of actually deleting the row.
**** Motivation 
     preserve all application data, typically for historical means.
**** Tradeoffs 
***** more data - table have to store valid rows and those mark as deleted 
***** performace - more data means reduction in query performace - the additional work of distinguishing between deleted and nondeleted rows
***** code complexity 
****** mostly in every query we would have to remember add 'where isDeleted = false'
****** You may have associations going from Table A to Table B and when you soft delete something from Table A, you need to ensure that independent queries on Table B take care of that fact. 
**** How
***** Introduce New Column
****** isDeleted 
******* bool not null false 
******* date/timestamp null
***** Update 
****** application 
****** database trigger - it is simple and it avoids the risk that the applications will not update the column properly      
**** Opposite
     Introduce Hard Delete
*** Introduce Surrogate Key 
    Replace an existing natural key with a surrogate key.
*** Introduce Trigger For History 
    Introduce a new trigger to capture data changes for historical purposes.
**** Motivation
     delegate the tracking of data changes to the database itself
   
*** Introduce Variable 
    Put the result of the expression, or parts of the expression, in a
    temporary variable with a name that explains the purpose.
*** Introduce View 
    Create a view based on existing tables in the database.
**** Motivation
***** Summarize data for reporting. Many reports require summary data, which can be generated via the view definition.
***** Replace redundant reads. Several external programs, or stored procedures for that matter, often implement the same retrieval query. These queries can be replaced by a common readonly table or view.
***** Data security. A view can be used to provide end users with read access to data but not update privileges.
***** Encapsulate access to a table. Some organizations choose to encapsulate access to tables by defining updateable views that external programs access instead of the source tables. This enables the organization to easily perform database refactorings such as Rename Column (page 109) or Rename Table (page 113) without impacting the external applications, because views add an encapsulation layer between your tables and your application.
***** Reduce SQL duplication. When you have complex SQL queries in an application, it is common to discover that parts of the SQL are duplicated in many places. When this is the case, you should introduce views to extract out the duplicate SQL, as shown in the example section.

**** Tradeoffs
***** poor performance of the joins
***** increases the coupling with database schemas

*** Make Column Non-Nullable 
    Change an existing column so that it does not accept any
    null values.
*** Merge Columns 
    Merge two or more columns within a single table.
*** Merge Tables
    Merge two or more tables into a single table.
*** Migrate Method From Database
    Rehost an existing database method (a stored
    procedure, stored function, or trigger) in the application(s) which currently invoke it.
*** Migrate Method To Database 
    Rehost existing application logic in the database.
*** Move Column 
    Migrate a table column, with all of its data, to another existing table.
*** Move Data 
    Move the data contained within a table, either all or a subset of its columns,
    to another existing table.
*** Parameterize Method 
    Create one method that uses a parameter for the different
    values.
*** Remove Control Flag 
    Use return or break instead of a variable acting as a control flag.
*** Remove Middle Man 
    Get the caller to call the method directly.
*** Remove Parameter 
    Remove a parameter no longer used by the method body.
*** Rename Column
    Rename an existing table column with a name that explains its purpose.
*** Rename Method
    Rename an existing method with a name that explains its purpose.
*** Rename Table
    Rename an existing table with a name that explains its purpose.
*** Rename View
    Rename an existing view with a name that explains its purpose.
*** Reorder Parameters 
    Change the order of the parameters of a method.
*** Replace Column 
    Replace an existing non-key column with a new one.
*** Replace LOB With Table 
    Replace a large object (LOB) column that contains structured data with a new table or in the same table.
*** Replace Literal With Table Lookup 
    Replace code constants with values from database tables.
*** Replace Method(s) With View 
    Create a view based on one or more existing database
    methods (stored procedures, stored functions, or triggers) within the database.
*** Replace Nested Conditional With Guard Clauses 
    Remove nested if conditions with a series of separate IF statements.
*** Replace One-To-Many With Associative Table 
    Replace a one-to-many association between two tables with an associative table.
*** Replace Parameter With Explicit Methods 
    Create a separate method for each value of the parameter.
*** Replace Surrogate Key With Natural Key 
    Replace a surrogate key with an existing natural key.
*** Replace Type Code With Property Flags 
    Replace a code column with individual property flags, usually implemented as Boolean columns, within the same table column.
*** Replace View With Method(s) 
    Replace an existing view with one or more existing
    methods (stored procedures, stored functions, or triggers) within the database.
*** Split Column 
    Split a column into one or more columns within a single table.
*** Split Table 
    Vertically split (e.g., by columns) an existing table into one or more tables.
*** Split Temporary Variable 
    Make a separate temporary variable for each assignment.
*** Substitute Algorithm 
    Replace the body of the method with the new algorithm.
*** Update Data 
    Update data within an existing table.
*** Use Official Data Source 
    Use the official data source for a given entity, instead of the
    current one you are using.

1) Accurate predictions are an oxymoron in the real world. You can't predict accurately for things that aren't certain, and in almost all cases, developers won't know the systems they are dealing with fully enough. Moreover, they don't know their own personal efficiency from day to day; it just can't be foreseen accurately.
2) Rules are for the guidance of the wise and the obedience of fools.
3) A good property of software is the ability to change 
4) Anyone can take a chance at improving code, but refactoring brings a discipline of safely making changes (with tests) and leveraging the knowledge accumulated by the software development community (through refactorings).
5) After all, like beauty, complexity is in the eye of the beholder. 
6) Using new programming languages will bring you new insights and ideas to already known languages. You get a better understanding.
7) It's not about clever, crAFTY, PREETY CODE. iT'S ABOUT FAST AND EFFECTIVE COMMUNICATION. It's about communication beetween people.
8) Any time someone sees some code that isn't as clear as  it should be, they should take the opportunity to fix it right there and then — or at least within a few minutes. This opportunistic refactoring is referred to by Uncle Bob as following the boy-scout rule — always leave the code behind in a better state than you found it.
9) software bugs are domiated by state
10) where software complexity comes from?
11) HN is fast because it is feature-barren.
12) The advantages of less lines of code are evident: a smaller program contains less bugs, is easier to reason about, and – because of its simplicity – is more robust.
13) Extracting statistical information from hundreds of processes without adversely affecting their performance is not a simple task.
14) Quality is many small things done right
15) The goal of refactoring is to improve the way that code reflects domain knowledge in a progressive way. The better the code expresses the domain, the easier it is to add new features or improve the existing ones. So, the main reason to refactor continuously is economics.
16) Any feature needs have enough usefulness to offset the extra complexity (maintainability, usability, performance, eco system impact) they add.
17) Simplicity: Managing Complexity. Small software projects can have delightfully simple and expressive code, but as projects get larger, they often become very complex and difficult to understand. This complexity slows down everyone who needs to work on the system, further increasing the cost of maintenance. A software project mired in complexity is sometimes described as a big ball of mud.
18) Organizing complexity is the most important skill in software development.
19) Software isn't the hard part; people are the hard part.
20) abyss of the rewrite
21) A mistake that kills many startups is premature scaling: adding too many people and processes before gaining significant traction. You cannot scale a product that is still taking shape. Until the product is validated, staying small is a competitive advantage.

**** if you are iterating an array to build another array from it, you should use map.

Proper use case of map:

const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
const doubled = numbers.map(n => n * 2);

console.log(doubled);
**** if you are trying to reduce the array to a value, for example, you want to sum an array of numbers, you should use the reduce method
Anti-pattern:

const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
const sum = 0;
numbers.forEach(num => { sum += num });
Proper use of reduce:

const numbers = [1,2,3,4,5];
const sum = numbers.reduce((total, n) => total + n, 0);

console.log(sum);
**** remove element by value 
     Well, deleting an element from array is basically just set difference with one element.

     array_diff( [312, 401, 15, 401, 3], [401] ) // removing 401 returns [312, 15, 3]
     It generalizes nicely, you can remove as many elements as you like at the same time, if you want.

     Disclaimer: Note that my solution produces a new copy of the array while
     keeping the old one intact in contrast to the accepted answer which
     mutates. Pick the one you need.
     #+begin_src php
function array_remove_by_value($array, $value)
{
    return array_values(array_diff($array, array($value)));

$array = array(312, 401, 1599, 3);

** Functions Core
*** SPL Library
Great job on the implementation!

For larger training jobs, wondering if it's worthwhile to investigate implementing SplFixedArray in to the class? While I'm not sure of the PHP7 impacts, for PHP < 7 this resulted in a memory reduction of 144 bytes per array element to 56 bytes per array element.

If you were working with 50M data points total, this would reduce the memory requirements from 7.2GB to 2.8GB.
*** As opposed with isset(), property_exists() returns TRUE even if the property has the value NULL.
*** isset() vs array_key_exist
In simple terms, isset() checks whether a variable exists or its been declared or not. This can be anything, an array, a particular key in an array or a variable. It also checks if a declared variable, array or array key has null value, if it does, isset() returns false, it returns true otherwise.

On the other hand, array_key_exists() checks whether a particular key or index exists in an array. It does not evaluate the value of the key for any null values. It returns false if it does not find the key in the array and true otherwise.

from the PHP manual: isset() does not return TRUE for array keys that correspond to a NULL value, while array_key_exists() does

    It’s also easy to believe that acquiring new stuff is more important than organizing old stuff. After all, organizing old stuff does not add value. It’s acquiring new stuff that counts. So if there’s any spare time, or spare effort, or spare energy, it should be directed towards acquiring new stuff. Organizing the old stuff is a waste.

** failing fast
   I’m so glad you brought this up @heidi. This is important, and words have immense meanings associated with them. In our team we have a wiki page called “Fail Wall”. The idea was to own our failures and write about them so others could see. After some time we realised that even in our open and honest team culture, a lot was just not being shared through that system.
   We changed the name to “Fabulous Failures” and added a description that we valued the learnings opportunity that failures brought with them, but to no avail.
   We then changed the page name to “Fabulous Learnings” and saw an immense improvement in engagement. Everything else on the page was the same, except the title. Also, people started speaking about learnings from other teams and sharing knowledge and thoughts. (edited)

** git 
   I’m cross-posting this comment here, which I also just posted in the Modern Agile slack channel about Safety.  It really bothered me to discover yesterday that in Xcode and in Git that there is a feature called “Blame”.  People might use that feature to see who made a change and when.  It came up in a discussion with an engineer who told me that she’d rather see the feature renamed to be “Praise” and that’s the word she uses when talking about the feature with her colleagues.  This is a reminder that, really, we have subtle messaging across our environments - potentially - that could put us at odds with each other.  It’s not like git or xcode are particularly new either.  When sharing code, don’t we want to have respectful communication that acknowledges the contributions we have made as part of the same team?  Calling a feature “blame” does not help here.  To me, if you think about that as a metaphor, it’s like finger pointing, and assumes that the person or people who last contributed did something wrong.  What do you think?
   @heidi You're right, and it goes even further. The name "git" is itself an insult. And Git's user experience is cruel and harsh, lacking compassion for users.

   Over the last decade I’ve noticed a lot of people joining the “The Code is the Documentation” line of thinking. Also known as “self documenting code”. The idea is that the code should explain itself, and comments are a crutch. If you just format your code with enough precision and are anal enough about your variable names, then this will solve all of the problems with managing complexity.

*** yml vs. annotations
    It's always have been a war about this. But I would simply divide them in to two options. Using annotations is quickier and kind of easier to use but it's increase noise in the code. I think it's great for prototyping small application, when you absolutly sure that app would not grow. Annotations become a tottaly mess when you have big application, it's hard to manage all routing compare to central routing like yaml.
    So I would go with word prototyping. Doctrine it's kind the same. It's great for prototyping but when you application finally reach maximum of what can you squize from ORM, you would have to leave it to pure SQL.

Next, he can distribute the hyperlink via email to a large number of bank customers. Those who click on the link while logged into their bank account will unintentionally initiate the $100 transfer.

Note that if the bank’s website is only using POST requests, it’s impossible to frame malicious requests using a <a> href tag. However, the attack could be delivered in a <form> tag with automatic execution of the embedded JavaScript.
This is how such a form may look like:

** metrics
*** cyclomatic Complexity Number (CCN) 
Counts the available decision paths in a source code to determine it's complexity.
Each decision path starts with one of the conditional statements from the following list:
- ?
- &&
- ||
- or
- and
- xor
- case
- catch
- elseif
- for
- foreach
- if
- while

  Cyclomatic Complexity Number is never less than 1, because there’s always at least one code path.
  - 1-4 has low complexity.
  - 5-7 is moderate and still easy to understand.
  - 6-10 has a high complexity.
  - 10+ is very complex and hard to understand.
#+BEGIN_SRC php
final class CyclomaticComplexityNumber
{
    // Class Cyclomatic Complexity = 1
}

final class CyclomaticComplexityNumber
{

    public function one()
    {
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 1
    }

    public function two()
    {
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 1
    }

    // Class Cyclomatic Complexity = 1
}

final class CyclomaticComplexityNumber
{

    public function one()
    {
        if(true){

        }
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 2
    }

    public function two()
    {
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 1
    }

    // Class Cyclomatic Complexity = 1 + 1 = 2
}

final class CyclomaticComplexityNumber
{

    public function one()
    {
        if(true){

        }
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 2
    }

    public function two()
    {
        if(true){

        }
        // Function Cyclomatic Complexity = 2
    }

    // Class Cyclomatic Complexity = 1 + 1 + 1 = 3
}
#+END_SRC

*** NPath Complexity
#+BEGIN_SRC php
function foo($a, $b)
{
    if ($a > 10) {
        echo 1;
    } else {
        echo 2;
    }
    if ($a > $b) {
        echo 3;
    } else {
        echo 4;
    }
}
#+END_SRC
So here we have function with 4 possible outcomes, since we have 2 statements that have 2 possible outcomes each (2 * 2 = 4). That means that the functions Npath complexity is 4. If we would add another statement with 2 possible outcomes we would get a complexity of 8 since 2 * 2 * 2 = 8.

** delete vs remove
   I disagree somewhat with the other answers implying that one of the terms is used in computer related matters, whereas the other less frequently so. In fact, I claim that both are used equally much to denote discrimination between two ways of managing data in DB and data in GUI.

   removed - the object is existing but not shown
   deleted - the object is not existing, hence not shown
   The phenomenon occurs due to the duality of the concept of existence. A record can be kept in the database but marked as inactive or retired. Then, it won't be shown in the graphic user interface. The perception is that it's not there but it is. Just not on display.

   Think of it as a phone book favorites, being a subset of all your contacts. You can get rid of one of the favorites in two way. Making it not-favorite makes it disappear from the list of favorites (you tamper with the display). Erasing it from the contacts makes it disappear from the list of favorites too (but you tampered with the data set and by extension with the display).

   Internet says: "Delete and remove are defined quite similarly, but the main difference between them is that delete means erase (i.e. rendered nonexistent or nonrecoverable), while remove connotes take away and set aside (but kept in existence)."

** setting negative numbers to zero in php
   A simple little trick in PHP for when you need to make sure that a value doesn’t drop below zero. For example, you might be subtracting a discount from a basket total and not want the amount to be paid to become negative.

   You could do this using a condition like this:-

   $total = -8;
   echo $total > 0 ? $total : 0; // Outputs '0'

   However, PHP has an method for doing this for us. We can use the max method.

   $value = -9;
   echo max($value, 0); // Outputs '0'

   All max does is return the larger number. So if $value is negative in this example 0 will be the larger number and be returned. If $value was positive, it would be greater than 0 and therefore $value would be returned.

   3. wszystko jest singular oprócz route z zasobem który jest plural
     
   Powiedzmy, że mamy CRUDa np. books. Więc controler + 4 methods dla view i controller + 3 methods API.

   |        |                 | BookController     | list                   | view   | /books           | book_list       | list          |
   |        |                 | API/BookController | show                   | view   | /api/books/{id}  | api_book_show   | show          |
   |        |                 |                    |                        |        |                  |                 |               |

   |        | GET             | BookController     | edit                   | view   | /books/{id}/edit | book_edit       |               |

   Pytania:. 
   1. CREATE - create czy add?
      | controller method name | route         | route name  |
      |------------------------+---------------+-------------|
      | create                 | /books/create | book_create |
      | add                    | /books/add    | book_add    |

      Ja bym trzymał się create bo:
      1. taka nazwa jest w CRUD
      2. myślę, że jest rozróżnienie pomiędzy utworzeniem 'create' jakiejś rzeczy/zasobu a jego dodaniem 'add' do innego zasobu.
	 np. tworzę book 'create' a później dodaje 'add' te ksiażkę do inngo zasobu np. /my-playlist/add/{book_id}  
   2. UPDATE - update czy edit?
      | controller method name | route              | route name  |
      |------------------------+--------------------+-------------|
      | update                 | /books/{id}/update | book_update |
      | edit                   | /books//{id}/edit  | book_edit   |

      Tutaj myślę, że jest największy problem. Bo wyraz edit, edytuj idealnie pasuje do opisywanej czynności w widoku strony. 
      W dodatku w j.polskim nie ma wyrazu który brzmi podpbnie jak 'update' - najbliżej byłoby 'aktualizuj'. A wszyscy mówią, że edytują daną stronę a nie ją aktualizują/updejtują.
      Mamy 'edycja, edytuj' więc użycie wyrazu edit będzie pasować idealnie.
      Tutaj ciekawy temat: https://english.stackexchange.com/questions/416094/are-there-any-differences-between-update-and-edit

           "I am from IT sphere. And in case of some MVC you may count next distinguish between these words:
   'edit' action is responsible for rendering the view (html form to POST data)
   'update' action is responsible for interacting with the model (db updates etc)""

   There are quite a few different aspects that might favour one or the other:

   Do you need/want to share this data between multiple servers? The filesystem is local, memcached is accessed over a network.
   How large are the items your caching? The filesystem is likely to be better for large objects.
   How many memcached requests might be there per page? TCP connections and tear-downs might take up more time than a simple filesystem stat() on the local machine.
   I would suggest you look at your use case and do some profiling of both approaches. If you can get away with using the filesystem then I would. Adding in memcached adds in another layer of complexity and potential points of failure (memcached client/server).

   For what it's worth the other comments about disk vs memory performance might well be academic as if the filesystem data is being accessed regularly then it'll likely be sitting in OS or disk cache memory anyway.

* parsowanie
  Hej, potrzebuję sparsować taką listę tworzoną w CKEditor. Chyba defaultowo jest ona zapisana do HTML.
  Wygląda mniej więcej tak - wraz ze źródłem HTML.

  <ol> <li>Kategoria Pralki <ol> <li>Pytanie 1? Czy dobrze pierze? <ol> <li>Odpowiedź na pytanie - tak oczywiście, tutaj link <a href="http://wp.pl">http://wp.pl</a></li> </ol> </li> <li>Pytanie 2? <ol> <li>Odpowiedź na pytanie drugie?</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li>Kategoria Samochody <ol> <li>Pytanie: jaki samoch&oacute;d jest najlepszy? <ol> <li>odpowiedź Ferrari</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li>Kategoria&nbsp; Świat <ol> <li>&nbsp;Pytanie kolejne? <ol> <li>Odpowiedz Maestro</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> </ol> 

  Zawsze będzie struktura - kategoria, która może mieć kilka pytań, a każde pytanie może mieć jedną odpowiedź.
  Próbuje od wczoraj z new DOMParser(). Ale ciągle mam problemy. Może jest jakieś prostsze rozwiązanie? Które by odrazu zamieniło to na nested array?

  #+begin_src javascript
  var html = "{{ entity.content|raw|spaceless|replace({'\n': '', '\r': '', '\t': ''})|e('js') }}";

  // const html = `<ol> <li>Kategoria Pralki <ol> <li>Pytanie 1? Czy dobrze pierze? <ol> <li>Odpowiedź na pytanie - tak oczywiście, tutaj link <a href="http://wp.pl">http://wp.pl</a></li> </ol> </li> <li>Pytanie 2? <ol> <li>Odpowiedź na pytanie drugie?</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li>Kategoria Samochody <ol> <li>Pytanie: jaki samoch&oacute;d jest najlepszy? <ol> <li>odpowiedź Ferrari</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> <li>Kategoria&nbsp; Świat <ol> <li>&nbsp;Pytanie kolejne? <ol> <li>Odpowiedz Maestro</li> </ol> </li> </ol> </li> </ol>`;
  // Tworzę parser.
  const domParser = new DOMParser();
  // Parsuję HTML.
  const dom = domParser.parseFromString( html, 'text/html' );
  // Wyciągam z niego główną listę (czyli tę pierwszą).
  const rootList = dom.querySelector( 'ol' );
  // Przekazuję ją do parseList().
  // Klonuję listę, zeby nie zmieniać tego, co wypluł mi parser.
  // Jeśli sparsowany HTML nie będzie nigdzie indziej wykorzystywany, mozesz przekazać bezpośrednio rootList.
  const questions = parseList( rootList.cloneNode( true ) );

  // Wyświetlam wynik.
  console.log( questions );

  function parseList( root ) {
  // Pobieram wszystkie elementy listy z 1. poziomu
  // Korzystam po prostu z własności children, bo zawiera wszystkie elementy-dzieci (a więc tylko li).
  // Nie mogę tutaj zrobić root#querySelectorAll(), bo to zwróci mi tez li z zagniezdzonych list, a tego nie chcę.
  // Przy okazji zamieniam od razu to na tablicę.
  const lis = [ ...root.children ];

  // Dzięki temu, ze zamieniłem to na tablicę, mogę teraz stworzyć oczekiwaną tablicę przy pomocy []#map().
  return lis.map( ( li ) => {
  // Wyciągam zagniezdzoną listę z poszczególnych li.
  // W tym celu mogę po prostu zrobić li#querySelector(), bo pierwsza lista to ta bezpośrednio w tym li.
  const ol = li.querySelector( 'ol' );

  // Jeśli zagniezdzona lista istnieje, usuwam ją z li.
  // Dla krótkiego zapisu stosuję optional chaining.
  ol?.remove();

  // Dzięki temu wiem, ze w li została sama treść pytania/nazwa kategorii i mogę tego uzyć bezpośrednio.
  // Wywołuję #trim(), zeby pozbyć się niepotrzebnych białych znaków z początku i końca.
  const content = li.innerHTML.trim();

  // Dla kazdego li zwracam tablicę, której pierwszy element to zawartość li a drugi – sparsowana wewnętrzna lista (jeśli taka istnieje).
  return [
  content,
  // Dla zagniezdzonej listy wywołuję parseList(), dzięki czemu zostanie sparsowana dokładnie tak samo jak ta główna.
  // Rekurencja często się przydaje w takich wypadkach.
  // Uzywam tutaj operatora trójkowego dla skrócenia zapisu:
  // jeśli ol istnieje, zostaje zwrócony wynik wywołania parseList() na nim, inaczej jest zwrócone null.
  ol ? parseList( ol ) : null
  ]
  } );
  }

  // A tutaj bonusowa wersja wypluwająca obiekt, nie tablicę.
  console.log( parseListObj( rootList.cloneNode( true ) ) );

  function parseListObj( root ) {
  const lis = [ ...root.children ];

  // Zamiast #map uzywam #reduce(), bo chcę zamienić tablicę na obiekt.
  return lis.reduce( ( result, li ) => {
  const ol = li.querySelector( 'ol' );

  ol?.remove();

  const content = li.innerHTML.trim();

  // Tworzę sobie obiekt dla tego li.
  const liObj = {
  // Klucz w nawiasach kwadratowych oznacza, ze chcę tam mieć wartość zmiennej content, nie klucz content.
  [ content ]: ol ? parseListObj( ol ) : null
  }

  // Do naszego obiektu z innymi pytaniami dodajemy obiekt z tego uzywając destrukturyzacji.
  return { ...result, ...liObj };
  }, {} );

*** code by refactoring
**** https://codebyrefactoring.slack.com/archives/CRG5YQFCG/p1650656529238389
     I really like this topic. I know 2 good books about it.
     1. Scott J Ambler and Pramod J. Sadalage Refactoring Databases - Evolutionary Database Design 2006
	refactoring must read It's catalog of refactorings for database, like Fowler's 'Refactoring...'
     2. Stephane Faroult, Pascal L'Hermite	Refactoring SQL Application 2008
	focused more on queries than schema, include nice sql recipies to compare two queries   	

     Once I was hired to fix database low performance - the main issue - using a lof of 'database views' and ORM.
     So deleting views and rewriting queries. It was one of my most pleasant work.
***** question
      Glad you like read by refactoring! What makes it useful to you?
**** pay down technical debt strategy
     I see four different ways an organization can devote effort to addressing the friction in software development (often phrased "pay down technical debt"):
     A. Centralized efforts. A full-time team works on a big problem that the whole org cares about.
     B. Centrally coordinated distributed effort. A small number or people decide on the work to do, make a big list of tasks, and then anyone/everyone across the organization can pick up a task and check it off the list.
     C. Team-scheduled tasks. A team decide to take on something that matters to them, and schedules time in the sprint to do so. Sometimes called "technical debt stories".
     D. Self-directed micro-improvements. Something annoyed us this morning, so this afternoon we're going to make it slightly better.

     Each has its place. Any improvement makes other improvements easier, so fans of one should be glad for the others. A and B make sense to VPs - they can decide to fund it and direct the org to carry it out, but they're only good at solving big problems. The 1000s of small problems that bother us every day need to be addressed in C and D. I especially love D because it's cheap, the payback is really quick, it's adapted to the real problems we experience instead of some visionaries belief about how things should be, and it displays profound trust of the people actually doing the work.Which of these does your organization tend to do more of / less of?
***** question
      @Jay Bazuzui good job with catching those 'pay down technical debt strategies'. Sorry for digging up an old thread.
      But this topic is the most important one for me. I would like to hear/read more about it. Right now I'm stuck with 'Centrally coordinated distributed effort' but I'm trying to convince managment to 'Self-directed micro-improvements'.
      I only have found two interesting sources about it. 
*** recommend book Refactoring for Software Design Smells: Managing Technical Debt; 2015
    I would like to recommend a book. Which I think is not very popular in menders community. 
    Fowler's 'Refactoring' was the first one in the field. So this is book number one on mender bookshelf.
    For me number two is - https://www.amazon.com/Refactoring-Software-Design-Smells-Technical/dp/0128013974
    The book is a catalog of smells. Focus on smell point of view. Also they introduce smell classification scheme, naming scheme for design smells which helps to increase awerness of smells. So definetly must read.
** Cusumano MA, Selby RW (1995) Microsoft secrets. Free Press, USA
   describe how Microsoft uses 20% of its development effort to re-develop the code base of its products
** Cusumano MA, Yoffie DB (1998) Design strategy. In: Competing on internet time. Free Press, New York, USA, pp 180–198
   report how Netscape’s inability to refactor the code base hindered their software development, and how Microsoft’s redesign efforts in the Internet Explorer 3.0 project later paid off.
